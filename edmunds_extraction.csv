You can try to revive this topic but without being able to discuss (however heated the discussion gets..or not) manufacturer verses manufacturer or model verses model (as in making comparisons) or issues with a specific manufacturer there is little to talk about. I do agree about issues with other members/posters however in spite of being guilty of doing just that. "

Model vs. model is exactly what we're here for! Manufacturer vs. manufacturer belongs elsewhere as I've noted a number of times. There were many times we were turning the previous discussion into conversations that were/are already occurring in Auto News and they were happening to the exclusion of the vehicles themselves. That's what we need to avoid this time around. "

The Altima is my favorite of the bunch. It is amongst the fastest and best handling of the group, is priced well, and has all the gadgets. The 2007 model is the best looker of the bunch, IMO. My second choice is the Ford Fusion. The things I don't like about it is the lack of punch, and it is gadget-free compared to the Altima. It is still fun to drive and is very nice looking inside and out, though. I hate the Camry's interior, and the Accord's seats. The Camry also feels a lot slower than its HP rating suggests, and the Nissan's motor wails on the Accord's whiny V6. Both Camry and Accord are kind of expensive for what you get. The Aura looks neat, but I've never driven one so I can't comment. The Mazda needs to be replaced. Not a bad car, but generationally it feels like a 2002 car and not 2007. I'll take the host's advice and spare any comments on the Hyundai and Kia.  "

Buick LaCrossePassat(Audi A6 in non-lux trim)Volvo S40(not really a luxury car, either, and not sporty like the S60)Jeep Compass(hard to tell if it's a car or a SUV wanna-be)Plus a few others, like the RX-8 and such that are technically sedans(a few two door sedans and hatchbacks would also qualify, IMO, if it's the only way they come)P.S. the CVT in the Altima has to be driven like a motorcycle. You need to floor the pedal until you reach the speed you want and ease off. Very binary behavior - and the opposite of a normal transmission. If you ease into it progressively harder, like you are used to, it accelerates like your grandmother. "

I have actually driven the CVT, and honestly it felt faster ""seat of my pants"" than any other car in this list did (of the ones I've driven). I didn't even notice the lack of shifting, I was having so much fun driving it. My daily driver is an '03 Maxima, and the '07 Altima does feel faster than the Max, though not by a ridiculous amount. It's pretty clear to me that the new Altima is the true successor to my car, and not the ""redesigned"" '04 and up Maximas. "

I wouldn't consider the RX-8, G35 coupe, or Saturn ION coupe to be midsized, no matter how many doors they have. I don't think the S40 is midsized either, being the same size as a Mazda3 or Focus.I think since ""sedans"" is in the title, the Compass (which is too small to be midsized anyway), wagons shouldn't count, gloried as a wanna-be SUV or not.

Very binary behavior - and the opposite of a normal transmission. If you ease into it progressively harder, like you are used to, it accelerates like your grandmother. Heh, maybe that's why I didn't notice a problem with the CVT. Typically, in rush hour traffic you don't really notice it, but when I'm going up an entrance ramp, for example, I will point the Maxima in the direction it needs to go, give it just a bit of gas so I don't spin the tires, and ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM. It's a lot like an airplane turning onto a runway for takeoff. That's how I drove the Altima, and the CVT must be a pretty good match for my driving style. I see people driving Maximas and Altimas like Buicks, and just shake my head. It's like, why didn't you just save $10k and buy an Impala?? They're four door sports cars, and I have the insurance tab to prove it (despite having zero accidents or tickets in my 15 years of driving). "

I personally found the Altima to be great looking but a bit pricey. I really, really like the Fusion. More than the Contour, that's for sure! I just couldn't get over the Fusion's lack of power compared to what I was used to, and could Ford put any more basic of a stereo into that car?? The car drove VERY well, and I really liked the interior/exterior of the thing. I suspect that when I go to replace my Maxima in a few years, I will get sticker shock. I got a tremendous deal on it since the redesigned '04s were like 2 weeks out, and the dealer wanted to get rid of the '03s BADLY. The Altimas are much more popular cars, and I'm sure my discount won't be nearly as nice. Then again, maybe I will be able to swing a G35 by the time my Maxima needs replacing. :shades: "

What do you think of the CVT in the Altima? I've heard some people say that it feels slow off the line even though it's not. depends how you drive it. Its computer controlled with 300 or so algorithms progamed into it. It kind of adapts to you. Personaly, I think it's incredible. But, you don't need to ""stomp"" on the gas to get it to go. durring the break-in period, I found myself having to watch the RPM's so as not to go over the 4000 the owners manual says to stay under. If you were to give it full acceleration, you'd go over 5000 rpm's and hit 60 mph in about 6 or 7 seconds. But, because it's so damn smooth and quiet, it doesn't feel like its moving that fast. But a quick look in the rear view, will show you how fast it's actually going. But in addition to that, you get much better acceleration at higher speeds, and it will employ engine braking on it's own when going down a steep incline. It deffinitly takes a couple hundred miles to get used too, but the CVT is undoubtly the future of transmissions. look for everybody to swithch to them in the next 5 years or so. The cvt will do to automatic transmissions what fuel injection did to carburators. "

The LaCrosse is a step up from the mid-sized sedans in this group. The Passat should qualify. The S40 is a compact car, on the Mazda3 platform. The Jeep Compass is a cross-over SUV. You would probably get laughed out of the Jeep dealership if you called it a ""mid-sized sedan.""I agree with other posters that the Malibu should certainly be mentioned in the banner of this discussion, and DC should be represented by the Sebring at least, if not by its Dodge cousin (even though I personally think they are woeful vehicles).

Our 2 person business jsut bought it's second Sonata. The '05 is GLS ""special value"" (an LX without leather or power seat). The '07 is an SE w/XM and floor mats. A couple less features, but a lot more safety features and some additonal goodies. My brother drives the '07 and almost everyday remarks about this feature or that, the power, the comfort, gas milage, etc. He says, ""Beats the (stuff) out of the '94 Olds 98 all around."" Better everything. His nose was down on Sonata unti I made him take one for a test drive. Everyone in he mid-sized market should consider Sonata. Sonata has come a long way since it was first introduced, how ever many years ago? "

what started this HP war in family sedans?? and where its going to stop. The Fusion which has the lowest HP/torque ratings in this class still does 0-60 in 7.0 seconds. Not bad for what is supposed to be a ""family sedan""?? Bragging rights is what manufacturers are after. My family sedan can do 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.. for me, so what?

I have read one or two comments here about the Aura and they were that the writer hadn't driven one.I have had my Aura XR for about a month now. My first GM car since 1972 (Vega Kahmback  )I am very impressed with the car in every aspect I buy a car for. I can only compare it here to the Chevy Impala and Malibu. I was within a day or two of buying a Chevy when I read about the 2007 Car of the Year. When I read about the Cadillac 3.6 L V6 producing 252 H-P and 252 Ft/lb of torque I was interested. Then I read it was connected to a 6 speed auto with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. I knew I had to drive one before I bought a chevy.One drive and I knew this was a way better car than the Malibu or Impala with either of the Chevy V6's 3.5 or 3.9 L engines. The Chevy's don't have Traction control, Stability control or half as many air bags as the Aura. So I was most impressed with the ride, handling, and the Oh My God acceleration. (hold on tight when you punch the 3.6 as the torque-steer will just about yank the steering wheel out of your hands.Ok! I lied, this was a nickels worth :shades: "

Is the horsepower of todays cars that different than the massive V8 horsepower wars of 30-45 years ago, really? I mean, if cars can have 260+ horsepower and have 2008 revised fuel economy estimates in the mid 20s combined like the Camry does, where is the problem? Bring on the power if the economy comes with it, I say. Apparently, power matters to some people, or they wouldn't get the V6 models. Personally, I drive the I4, since economy matters to me.It has more safety content than the Ford you chose, interestingly. You value different things however, so the Ford was right for you obviously.Here is a rundown of 2007 model vehicles with the new 2008 EPA estimates, for everyone's reference (all automatics):Chevy Malibu 2.2L I4 - 21/31Chevy Malibu 3.5L V6 - 19/30Chevy Malibu 3.9L V6 - 16/23Ford Fusion 2.3L I4 - 20/29Ford Fusion 3.0L V6 - 18/26Honda Accord 2.4L I4 - 21/31Honda Accord 3.0L V6 - 18/26Hyundai Sonata 2.4L I4 - 21/30Hyundai Sonata 3.3L V6 - 18/27Kia Optima 2.4L I4 - 21/31Kia Optima 2.7L V6 - 20/28Mazda 6 2.3L I4 - 21/28Mazda 6 3.0L V6 - 17/25Mitsubishi Galant 2.4L I4 - 20/27Mitsubishi Galant 3.8L V6 - 16/25Nissan Altima 2.5L I4 - 23/31Nissan Altima 3.5L V6 - 20/26Toyota Camry 2.4L I4 - 21/30Toyota Camry 3.5L V6 - 19/28I left out some models (this took awhile!) but for more info, check out fueleconomy.gov "

It could be that (though it would seem to me the Mazda6 would then get the better rating). Rounding may exaggerate differences. If two cars are measured at 29.4 and 29.6 mpg, one gets a rating of 29 and the other 30.I think I have read that there are some differences in the tuning of the engines and maybe in the heads, also.

The bigger V6 is great, but its one of the few midsizers with a manual transmission (although a 6 speed manual like the MazdaSpeed6 would be fine with me) and not everyone wants or needs the weight and fuel economy penalty associated with AWD.If you are looking for a powerful AWD midsized sedan, I would look at a Legacy GT.

I saw a report in my local paper yesterday that noted a Motor Trend story (not yet on their web site) about the new Mazda6. It said the styling would be daring, with the roof swept back behind the driver for a sleek look even if it takes away rear head room. Looking around the web, there is general consensus that tne new 6 will be considerably bigger (for more rear leg room) and more powerful than the current model, with the Ford 3.5L V6. I would like to see it get an economical I4 with decent power and a 6-speed stick in the low-end trim line. "

I have been driving Accords for 16 years now. 12 years with the first one, and 4 years (with many more to come) on the second. The Accord, despite being a 5 year old design, competes or beats cars that are completely new designs. Some competitors have more hp, and some even have better fuel economy, but the Accord's total package is hard to beat. The attention to detail, keeps the Accord at the top of the heap. Tight build quality, great ergonomics, smooth ride, confident handling, smooth drivetrains, and good power in I4 or V6 versions add up to a car that does everything very well. If you are looking to buy a midsize sedan, I highly recommend the Accord. I have to warn you that this car could spoil you, and you will not be able to consider another brand again.  "

I guess we'll have to see the new Mazda6 to see what the rear seat accomodations are like, but what I'd expect is that, if they use a swept-back roofline but a longer wheelbase, they could mount the rear seat low (ala Civic or Prius) and still have enough head room--albeit maybe not class-leading headroom.

I am struggling with the trend to make everything bigger.I think this is an American thing. We seem to be living longer, and growing larger. I am a few inches taller, and a few pounds heavier than my father. Most of my friends seem to be larger than their parents too. If you are one of us, you appreciate the interior space. If you don't feel the need for more space, I still don't see the problem. If you would be content will the space of say a 96 Accord, you can get that from the current Civic. The 96 Altima is probably about the same size as the current Sentra. As we Americans get larger and larger, our cars are growing with us. "

I had the opportunity to compare the Altima and Versa side-by-side at my local auto show recently. When the driver's seat was adjusted for my 5'10"" frame, the Versa had noticeably more legroom than the Altima. Part of that was because the Versa had lots of foot space under the driver's seat, moreso than the Altima.Every review I've read on the new Altima notes its reduced rear legroom compared to the prior generation. Not that the legroom is unacceptable for a mid-sized sedan (not nearly as crasmped as the Mazda6 or Legacy, for example), but it's no longer at or near the top of the class in that regard. "

I read the same complaints about the Contour, which was a little tight, but the back seat was usable and at least set at a comfotable height.

Everyone's legs are different. I know for example that the Mazda6 has less rear leg room than my previous-gen Elantra, a compact car. I would not reject the Mazda6 only because of its rear leg space, as I think it's adequate (barely) for my needs, but my point is that most mid-sized cars have more interior volume and rear-seat space than the Mazda6. Even the current-gen compact Elantra has more of both. When I pay for a mid-sized car, I'd like mid-sized room. Otherwise I may as well buy a compact and save the extra bucks. "

Altima notes its reduced rear legroom compared to the prior generation.Yes, it is a little less, but fairly negligable. It was the rear headroom that was hit hardest because of the slopping roofline, though it will still comforably fit people under about 6'2. But the aim for the 07 redesign wasn't to lead the class in leg, head, or overall room. It was to be the best handling front wheel drive sedan on the road. Wheather or not it sucseeded is pretty subjective, but with the near elimination of torque steer, fastest 0-60 time ect, its by far the best performing altima yet.

Sometimes I will drive somewhere 5-600 miles just because I enjoy driving. But the car has to be comfortable, and easy to drive. I drove to northern Arkansas (700 miles) to visit my sister once in a pickup truck. That was not enjoyable, at all. Never again, I couldn't wait to get home. I need something easy to drive and comfortable. Considering I've had back surgery for two ruptured disks in my lower back, lumbar support is also a necessity. "

I remember that you are very big on Honda and down on the Sonata. Have you driven an '07 Sonata? It seems to have everything you want in a car and more. If you haven't tried it, you might be very pleasantly surprized. My brother got a new Sonata the end of Feb. He was amazed at the stability control and traction control on two different snowy days. He wasn't sure what was happening, at first, just that the car did what he was intending it to do. "

No, I have not driven a Sonata. I have driven Camrys, and from what I've heard the Sonata is patterned after the Camry, and has many of the same dynamics. I have driven a new Optima (don't know how similar they are), and was not impressed with the driver's seat (or much else). It reminded me of the thinly padded seat in my old Nissan Sentra work car. Honda has a reputation that I trust. I could spend my $$$ on it, knowing I would be satisfied. Hyundai is something I would be taking a chance on, and I am not a risk taker. As far as the snow thing, in south Louisiana we may get snow once every 20 years (I am 44 years old, and have seen snow here twice, and maybe an inch or two). "

Of course the Buick LaCrosse qualifies. It certainly isn't a luxury car, and GM placed it as the replacement for the Regal. Cost-wise, it's right where the Accord and others are as well.Small car?

Elroy,Autocross is typically a ""course"" configured with a bunch of traffic cones in a parking lot. Emphasis is much more on driver skill and car control than overall top speed, as cars rarely get above 2nd gear.HPDE stands for high performance driving event, which used to be called ""hot lapping days"" at local road courses. In California, this means Willow Springs (and 'Streets), Buttonwillow, Laguna Seca, Sears Point, etc. The Contour with slightly upgraded brakes and R-compound tires was amazingly competitive in its class. Incidentally, the early 90s Accords do well in autocross type events, especially with a warmed over suspension.Anything off road will have a very different suspension, there might be some confusion between rally-cross (auto-cross in the mud) or true rally stage races and the on-pavement events.That said, stock road going versions of the WRX/STI and EVO (the Subie and Mitsu) are very popular at these events beginning in the late 90s when the Civic and Sentra started to lose their sport compact following. Like I said earlier, if BMW can have the ride/handling balance they had in 1992/3, why can't other automakers figure out how to do that now? "

Toyota seems to be very profitable at high volume and has the biggest selling mid-size car, despite the fact that you (or I) will not buy one. This is likely due to the fact that Toyota doesn't try to sell ""clearance rack"" vehicles, which many automakers have been guilty of, less so recently. They build (arguably maybe, lately) high-quality cars for the most part, and don't have to sell them at major discounts. People like high-quality, and apparently are willing to pay a little more for it. I imagine when Honda comes out with is new Accord, prices will be right back at sticker (as opposed to right now where people are getting real steals of $1,000-$1,500 below invoice since the current Accord is in its last few months of life). Honda also builds high(er) quality vehicles than much of its competition, and people are willing to pay more for it (and when the higher sale price outweighs the higher build price due to better quality, more profit is had).

Toyota seems to be very profitable at high volume and has the biggest selling mid-size car, despite the fact that you (or I) will not buy one.As Toyota exec said at NAIAS 2 years ago: the number one selling ice cream flavor in the US is vanilla. Big companies like Toyota design their vehicles to appeal to the broadest group. They are designed to not offend anyone and have a high feature content. They make relatively few models (the Honda 2 model 3 trim line is the master of this) and they will work for most of the people. Its the people that want something more interesting or exciting that don't meet the criteria.Smaller companies like BMW design vehicles to appeal to those who do want something with a little more soul. An example is very few Toyotas are available with a manual transmission (and since its only ~8% of the market, Toyota doesn't care), while almost every BMW is available with a manual transmission.BMW is low volume relative to other manufacturers (VW, Peugeot, Renault) even in Europe. They are also very profitable. "

I'm going to tackle several replies in one post, so bear with me...In automotive technology they are somewhat behind the curve (less efficency and less power from the engine in the Fusion vs. that in the Accord). They are not so behind as to be ridiculed too harshly, however (Ok, the 4.0L in the Explorer and Mustang is a rough old dog compared with the sixes of THIS century) but the Fusion is perfectly adequate and is competitive.In reliability, Ford's Fusion is doing quite well. Unfortunately that doesn't translate across the line, however (my parents are shopping for a second car, possibly a convertible, or maybe an SUV - the Explorer and the Mustang were both unable to be recommended by CR because of poor relibaility). The Fusion however, is well above average according to CR.For some in this forum, it seems that you are more defensive of your choice than you have to be. Nothing in here has to get personal, and because one person drives a Nissan and another drives a Toyota, it doesn't mean that the driver of one thinks the buyer of the other is stupid, so quit implying that. Quality IS perception, scape. I ""perceive"" the knobs, buttons, materials, and design to all be of higher quality, with better motion to things like blinker stalks, HVAC, and stereo, in my Accord than in the Fusion. You perceive it differently. If it's not perception, I'd love to see the quantitative facts proving different. Otherwise, it is subjective perception. "

Fusion is a good car, however in my opinion the Accord is still better, for the following reasons:Reliability: not a landslide, Fusion appears to be ""above average"" according to most sources so far, however Accord is tops. This isn't perception, Accord reliability and longevity is well documented, and although Fusion is being received well, it is an unknown, and Fords of the past have been so-so (I won't buy another one after my 2004).Resale value: I know many people intend to keep their cars longer than the early (1-5) years where depreciation matters most, but cars can be stolen or totaled, and value counts. I suspect the difference between values of used Accords and used Fusions will typically be more than the difference in purchase prices when new. Even really old Accords command serious money; I sold a 10-year old Accord with 140,000 miles for $4,000. Try that with a Ford.Interior: Accord interior is more attractive and comfortable (to me). All of the controls feel much more sophisticated and pleasing to operate.Refinement (especially engine and trasmission): big advantage for the Accord.I drive a 2007 Accord 4-cylinder with a manual, and have been very impressed so far at 3,000 miles total. I don't miss having a V6 at all, it is a quick car at about 7.5 seconds to 60. That's not far off from a Fusion V6 (and I have tested this myself by driving both cars, plus last weekend when a Mazda6 V6 Auto tried to beat me from a red light to get into my lane). Great mileage too, just got back from a business trip and pulled 34mpg at 80mph with the AC on. "

there is an interesting graphic in this year's CR 07 automotive issue, a line chart comparing the reliability (problems per 100 vehicles) of all brands over longer periods of time - out to 10 years. Ford, while middle of the pack, does do better than GM/Chrysler. The top 3? Toyota/Honda/Nissan in that order - by substantial margins. While it does appear that Ford can build better cars in Mexico than they can in this country, the jury is still out on things like the Fusion, it just hasn't been around long enough yet and unlike those 'Japanese 3' Ford doesn't have the same sort of history producing quality vehicles that those mfgrs. do.

I've come to the conclusion (after reading this forum for a while) that each person's idea of a ""Great Car"" can be as different as his/her favorite food. For some, an automatic transmission car, can have no ""Soul"". Others believe that if a car does not handle like a sports car, it's boring. I would submit to you that even Buick owners can feel as passionate about their car, as you do. I enjoy driving as much (or more than) the next guy, and I don't have to be shifting it manually, or going around corners with my hair (what little there is) on fire. Constantly shifting in heavy traffic, and being pounded by a stiff suspension, is not my idea of enjoying the ride. BMW did not corner the market on ""Soul"". Many Accord owners feel as (or more) passionate about their cars, as BMW owners do, believe it or not. Luckily different car makers make different cars, so we can all find the one we like best.  "

The fusion is deffinitly a step forward for ford, and was designed to try and recapture some of the lost market share. We'll have to wait a couple years to see if it pans out. But the reason, as I said before, is simple. Ford simply neglected the passenger car market in favor of trucks and SUV's And it worked great. Back when SUV/truck sales exceeded car sales, Ford made a killing. And, they still dominate in those categories. The problem for them the last couple years is gas. with the price staying consistently above $2.00, people are returning to cars. And Ford has some catching up to do. And while ford was letting their best selling cars like the taurus and escort die a slow painful death, the big three asian manufactures were making their cars better and better. Ford was content to let them have that and focus on the much more profitable SUV/truck market. Ditto for GM.and another part of the problem is Hundai and Kia. Even when toyota/honda/nissan began to pass ford/gm in quality and reliability, the US automakers always had them in price. You could always save several thousand buying domestic. But with hundai/kia, the pricing advantage dissapeared. I doubt hundai/kia sales cut into toyota/honda/nissan much. Most of their sales probably came from the domestic three. "

What the best car choice is for any individual varies depending upon what that person finds important.For instance, I've always liked how a Honda Accord drives but have never included an Accord in my final list when sedan shopping? Why? The back seat room just doesn't compare well against competitors. This back seat deficit spans several generations of Accords. The Accord is the perfect car for lots of people. It's just not the right choice for me.I think the lack of back seat room was also the biggest problem for Ford's Contour. It didn't have Honda's reputation for reliability or quality to make-up for the lack of rear seat legroom.There are a lot of other preferences or priorities that can influence an individual's choice. The local dealer matters. Toyota manufacturing may be great, but if the local Toyota dealer is terrible (like mine), a great Toyota is a bad choice. No car is good enough to make up for a bad dealer experience.I wish people would be more nuanced in their critiques. Resale value and reliability are not the only priorities that people balance when spending money. Repeating ad nauseum well-known strengths and never exploring other vices or virtues is a disservice to people looking for reasons to differentiate between the spectrum of choices available in the marketplace. Further, the statistical variations in ""quality"" or ""reliability"" are often far smaller than the perceptions. A market that failures to acknowledge real improvements sends very inconsistent messages to manufacturers. "

I'll agree, the ""compact"" Accords of 1997 and previous (I have a 1996, and the back seat is about like today's Civic) had a small back seat. Have you tried a recent Accord? I think you'll find it very competitive to other cars in its class (Altima, Camry, 6).I have a 2006 as well as a 1996 Accord, so I can compare both. I'll agree that back seat room isn't plentiful in the older models, but in 1998 it gained 3 inches of rear legroom, and more with the 2003 redesign. In 1997 and before, it was a ""compact"" car, but it moved up into ""midsize"" in 1998.Just something you may consider if you haven't looked at Accord lately, look again. "

 Almost every other vehicle I've had has been able to get me to school or work or both and back, and been an entertaining autocross or HPDE companion.No midsize car is designed for that. Not even a 6. actually the 6 has done quite well in the World Challenge Touring Car Championship over the last few years. granted it's a souped up version with many aftermarket parts, but it does show how good of chassis the 6 has. And keep in mind, the 6 is the only midsize sedan in this group that has been chosen as Consumer's Digest Most Sporty Cars of 2007. I know several people who autocross their 6 who do quite well in their class. But even if they rank poorly, the 6 is fun to drive, and on top of that an autocross course will always make you a better driver since you will better understand the limits of your car. Perhaps this why the 6, despite it's being one of the oldest designs in this segment, continues to be rated highly by writers who find driving enjoyable/ fun and more than just a way to get from A to B. As Edmunds wrote in their summary of why they chose the Mazda 6 as the Editor's most desired sedan under $25k for 2007, ""...the 6 offers comfort, capability and class for a surprisingly affordable price. Fun to drive, with smooth power delivery from the automatic, the 6 features a slick-shifting manual transmission if you so choose. Design is simple and tasteful inside and out."" If you are a person who likes to occasionally take turns faster than most others or like to find gaps in traffic to get ahead of it, you will enjoy the Mazda 6's great handling characteristics. "

Actually, I think I'd be quite happy with the Accord (much happier, I think, with the next gen accord). In fact it was second or third on my list of cars I would have bought. But it was the the flexibility of a hatchback the sealed the deal on the 6. I've had 2 Accords in the past and liked them a lot, especially the coupe where I learned how handy a hatchback can be while still looking good. I especially like Honda's center console and manual tranny - my favorites in this class. Really, I could make a very strong case for the Accord. But when it came down to signing the dotted line, I had a stronger case for the Mazda based on my wants and needs. btw - from a suspension/ ride viewpoint, I don't think the Accord is in the middle of this group. I'd rate it in the top 3 for firmest suspension in this group (granted none of these cars have a really ""firm"" suspension...they're family cars after all; but some are firmer than others). "

Why give it a rest? It it because its a Camry it should not be questioned?No, but it would be a bit different if we hadn't all gone down this road before in the last room, that got shut down for its redundant arguing.Why do you constantly imply that the Camry and Accord are on some pillar of greatness, while you tout yourself as a martyr buying a ""lowly Ford Fusion?""I've already said it once today, but I'll say it again... All Honda and Toyota owners do not think that Ford owners bought a sub-par vehicle, just one that didn't meet their needs as well, which, last I checked, is what you did. You wanted a fun car, with a V6, great styling, and a very reasonable price. The Fusion certainly delivers on that. I wanted a fun car, with great economy, and the best interior for my budget. For me, the Accord delivers.Do I cry ""look at me, i took a chance on poor old Honda"" though? Nah, I'm too busy driving! I also don't sarcastically berate other car manufacturers, like you constantly do to Honda, and especially Toyota.

I think in the 90s, Honda had the best FWD manual transmission in the business. I think the current Accord is highly competitive although perhaps not class-leading. A short throw shift kit like Subaru offers would help the feel a lot.Also in the olden days of yore (the mid 90s :P ) it was pretty easy to pick up aftermarket suspension components for Hondas that firmed them up quite a bit (shocks, sway bar links, and bushings) could button things down while not dramatically affecting ride quality, slaming the thing to the ground, or most importantly, knocking me out of stock classes.Toyota has TRD, Subaru has STI, even Chrysler has DirectConnection, but Honda lacks an in-house aftermarket performance supplier. These places allow one to add performance without affecting warranty, etc. "

Honda lacks an in-house aftermarket performance supplier.While not being a full line, they do offer the ""A-Spec"" upgrades. Just thought I'd mention that. I think the current Accord is highly competitive although perhaps not class-leading.For the current Accord to be near the top of the pack five years after being introduced (and with all other cars except the Mazda 6 being redesigned since then) I'd say Honda has performed an amazing feat. I must say, some of use feel it is still at the top of the pack (those that bought one obviously  as well as the latest tests of the Accord, placing it ahead of the Optima, Camry, Altima, Sebring, and Aura.This is the most recent post in the Accord Prices paid forum:Earlier this month I purchased a 2007 Honda Accord SEDAN (not the coupe) EX-L V-6 Automatic Transmission with Navigation for $25,061.76 (NOT INCLUDING TAX AND TAGS). That is a $30,000 car for $25,000. If you like the Accord in its current iteration, now is the time to get a steal. This price is $5,000 below sticker, and fairly typical on the forum, opposed to some people who imply that ""Honda dealers don't deal."" It just isn't true, they do! "

Ford simply neglected the passenger car market in favor of trucks and SUV's... I think you have reversed cause and effect. The consumer did not want to buy cars, they wanted to buy SUVs and trucks. Ford produced vehicles to meet that demand. The F-150 is still the biggest selling vehicle in the US and the Siverado is second.What happened to new cars that Ford did come out with? In 1995 the Contour (a smallish midsize car, imo) was introduced and it never did sell well in the US, a new version of it is still going as the Mondeo elsewhere. Getting back to current mid-size cars, in the recnet past I've read some complaints here on edmunds and elsewhere along the lines of ""why doesn't Ford bring the new Mondeo to the US?"" Well, my understanding is that car starts at about $27K in Europe, does anyone really think this would sell here at anything close to that price? I don't...they could maybe try to sell it, in very limited numbers, as a Lincoln, replacing the Fusion sibling. "

The only negative I noticed was the steering was too light. I did not give it serious consideration, because I really don't like the appearance and then on top of that the price would have been much higher than my Mazda6.

I think you have a valid point on the GM pushrod V6, but that should not be classified with the current Ford V6. The 2.3L 4 cyl first came out in 2000, that is not antiquated. I don't know enough about whatever Sebring is using to comment. Anyway, I think Ford/Mazda has updated these engines over time and they do put 5 and 6 speed automatics in the Fusion/6.

I'd put the 6, accord, and altima as having the least amount of body roll when turning and having firmer suspensions than others. the sonata, legacy and fusion are pretty close in suspension firmness to those that I've mentioned, though body roll in the sonata seemed much higher than the others. strange since I thought the suspension was pretty firm but well dampened unless you hit something like a highway expansion joint.

When looking for a new car, I did test drive the Fusion, and found it to be pretty good in handling. The Sonata seems to not have the same abilities in cornering, and the suspension from time to time thumps, like it has bottomed out. I ended up with the Accord SEV6, which has the 17"" wheels. Great handling, a little firm with those lower profile 17"" rims on the V6 model, but not too harsh. That said, my Dad prefers his 2000 Camry softer ride, so it ain't for everyone. The i4 Accords, with 16"" wheels may have a tad bit more softness to the ride. The double wishbone suspension works like a champ for handling. And the SEV6 comes with the stability control standard.The Fusion, and Sonata are good cars, but with the Accord SE package, and current discounting going on for Hondas (check more than one dealership) it was just so much more of a deal overall than I could get on other cars tested. The Accord is now at a low price to buy, and has the resale value, and overall refinement. While the interior of the Fusion, Sonata and others like the Aura are OK, the Accord to me just seems one notch above. Same goes for the Honda engines. Smooooooth! When pushed, they make some sweet engine sounds, and do not sound at all like rattly old four bangers and V6 of days-gone-bye American engines. Attention to detail points go to Honda. Fusion is still using a rod to prop up the hood -- what's up with that? The Fusion was fun enough to drive, and the Sonata has some good room inside, but seemed less interesting - more like an Impala. The Aura XR is one more exciting car to drive. I would say it comes closer to Honda / Camry for total points. It is sporty, a little more narrow, but overall pretty comfy. Aura XR and Accord were the too best overall rides I found. The Altima was another one I test drove, but it seemed not as quiet, had that different feel of the CVT transmission, I do not care for, and a strangely place emergency foot brake. Altima does have a nice look and some interesting gadgetry, like the push button start / stop button. I guess that is a good thing??If I lived in snow country, I would at least test drive a Legacy. I would have done a quick test run in a Legacy sedan, but none were on the local dealerships lot. Seems they sell more other types of Subarus.Did not test drive the new Camry. Too worried about the first year run cars possible defects. And the interior looked a bit misaligned, and/or something just not right about the overall appearance of several areas on the interior. The exterior is OK, with the funny nose up front as one sore spot. Camry typically doesn't excite one for handling, though my Dad's car, the 2000 Camry, is not bad. I was looking for a bit more snappy handling. :shades: Loren "

Ford and GM are not the cause of the SUV crazeI never meant to imply they were. but when it hit, they focused entirely on it, to the detriment of their passenger car line.

It's not to say they won't be alright in the end, just that their years of neglect in the passenger car market has left them with some catching up to do. It's made big news lately that toyota passed ford in sales, and will soon pass GM. Well, they did that in the passenger car market years, and years, and years ago.

A 24v v6 Dual overheadcam engine that does have VVT.big deal, it is still a 15 year old design that is rough as a cob, and further sounds like something's going to blow when and if you ask anything from it. A good illustration of why there is more to an engine that what we can read on a spec sheet and a genuine problem with this particular engine specifically noted in about every road test or consumer magazine that has looked at the thing over the last 10 years or so. I don't consider this 'bashing' at all, more an opinion (shared by others that know a lot more about this than I do) that I have that the Fusion/6, in this case, need better engines if they truly are to be regarded as comparable to the Camcordimas or even the Sonatas currently available - gimmicks like AWD and sponsored comparos notwithstanding. GM is finally starting to weed out all their multiple pushrod V6s, the new 3.6 a reasonable engine in the Aura (and the next Malibu), why not Ford?

The 6-speed tranny in the Fusion is sourced from Aisin or Jatco, I can't remember which one it is. From what I've read it would only take a software tweak to allow for the manumatic functionality in that tranny but Ford left it out for their own reasons. I personally don't care for the manumatics myself as I'd rather have a stick. The lack of a stick with the V6 in the Fusion alone will keep me from ever buying one. IMO the lack of manumatic in the Fusion probably displeases the same amount of people as the lack of a stick does.

agree about the Fusion/Mazda6 engine, that Duratec 30 has been around forever and although it has been updated, basically it has stayed the same when it comes to NVH and general feel/refinement. Its funny that 10 years constitutes forever nowadays. It was introduced in '96. The Vulcan 3L has been around forever (well at least since the Taurus of '86). By comparison, the K-family of engines (K24 is in the Accord) has been around since about 2000 or so, and the B-series it replaced had been around since about 1990 or so.I had a 2.5L V6 in the old 626 which was sort of related to the Duratec 25 from the Contour, just worked over by Mazda. Actually, the Duratec 2.5l in the Contour (introduced in '94) was totally unrelated to the Mazda 626/MX6/Ford Probe engine. The MPV shared the same block as the Contour but used different intervals.In the mid/late 90s, Mazda got the AJ with VVT, but I think that was only in the minivan until they 3.0 duratec went in the Mazda6.

I made what I thought was an innocent comment otherwise praising the Honda Accord but ruling it out for a relatively small backseat. I apparently offended at least one Honda fan and was challenged to prove it.I could answer that perceived size is enough to settle it for any consumer that values rear seat leg room in a midsize sedan. Most consumers don't get out the tape measure. But to be fair and contribute to the discussion I went back and looked up the data with the midsize sedans I am actually considering (with one five door included because it was on my list). The cars are a pretty good cross section of mainline 2007 midsize sedans: Impala, Malibu MAXX (the five-door), Camry, Sedona, Fusion and Accord.I looked at reported rear leg room, rear hip room, rear shoulder room, and rear head room. In every circumstance but one (the Malibu's rear hip room), the Accord was the smallest dimension or tied for the smallest dimension. I totaled the four measures for some rough measure of total differences. The Accord was smallest with the Fusion slightly larger. The Sedona and Impala were significantly larger. The Camry was in the middle. The MAXX does well for four passengers because it has great legroom and headroom on a narrower chassis. This pretty much parallels my perceptions. The Sedona and Impala were in fact my finalists partly because of interior space.Again, I love how Accords drive. The current Accord has a marvelously designed dash, both in function and aesthetics. It just doesn't have a large back seat. It is driver focused (not necessarily bad, if that's your priority). It is not as well disposed to transport three or four adults of 5' 10"" or taller in long distance comfort. To my senses the Accord may even feel smaller due to the shape of the roof and C pillar. The Fusion feels bigger to me than its actual dimensions revealed.I'll restate my point. The best car varies based upon your priorities. As good as an Accord is (and I acknowledge it has many virtues), this one weakness is fatal given my priorities in buying a midsize sedan. I'm not saying anyone has to have the same priorities, but given the number of Sedonas and Impalas I see, I suspect I have company.I'd guess there are also other, similar, differentiating criteria beyond just resale value and reliability or perceived quality.

The Accord and Fusion have the same size engine (3.0 liter V6). The Fusion engine is ""dual"" overhead cam with VVT. The Accord engine is ""single"" overhead cam with Vtec. The Accord V6 engine amazingly has 20 more hp, and runs smoother and quieter. So the Fusion engine should at least have better fuel economy, but sadly it doesn't. Engine design, therefore, must be more important than the number of camshafts. The Duratec 30 is not outdated, or antiquated, so what's the problem? "

The design has been around since 03 which may be outdated to some, but certainly is still competitive in 07. I can't wait to see what the 08 will add to this competitive market.

Once again PERCEPTION. Someone in the last sedan room posted 0-60 numbers and 45 - 60 numbers for the 4cyl Fusion vs Camry vs Accord and the numbers showed different. The 4cyl Fusion if I remember was .1 second slower 0 - 60 .. Perception.Searching through the last sedan room, I didn't find the post you mentioned, that had numbers showing a Fusion 4-cylinder was .1 second slower 0-60 than an Accord 4-cyl.I did find a post that referenced these numbers from Consumer Reports:Honda Accord sedan - I4 2.4L (166 hp) 5A + ABS 7.91 16.22 90.80Honda Accord sedan EX - V6 3.0L (244 hp) 5A + ABS 7.80 15.88 93.70 Ford Fusion SEL V6 - 3.0L DOHC (221 hp) 6A + ABS 7.47 15.78 92.30 Ford Fusion SEL - I4 2.3L (160 hp) 5A + ABS 9.36 17.27 82.50 Anyways, not that the actual numbers matter all that much, you keep keying in on PERCEPTION... Well, since I dove a couple of Fusions before I bought my Accord, and I perceived that A) they were much slower, and  flooring the cars was not fun, as the engines were rough and harsh... I felt that was significant.It's not so much the age of the Duratec 30 that is an issue. It is that harshness at high RPMs has been a criticism for many years and Ford hasn't found a way to fix that. Why can't Ford make a V6 for a midsizer that has a high RPM and is smooth and refined such that it makes you want to open it up? "

I got about $1,600 off sticker. I hear of much larger discounts. Could be why I got a pretty good trade-in for my PT Cruiser. I would expect somewhere around $1,600 to possibly as much as $2,000 or more off on the SEV6, which is a great pkg. There are claims of $4,000 or more off, but it is hard to believe. I was pleased to see over $1,000 off on a Honda, as discounts are tight compared to other cars. Resale on Honda Accords is outstanding. At least here in California, they are as good as gold. At around $22,000 say for discounted Accord SEV6, I think it is a very good deal. So you got a Sonata SE, I assume V6, for $16,651 ???

Does the "" L "" chose from 2 or 3 lower gear selections? The Fusion automatic may work just fine for most all occasions.A stick can be fun, but not around town. I prefer a stick on a sports car, preferably RWD. For FWD, from now on, I will stick with automatics. My Accord has the D3 selection for gears, and that seems to work for those times in town you wish for only three gear shifts, or on the twisty roads when you do not want a taller gear, or changes going on as much during corners. It has some sort of grade logic to the automatic too, which helps. I will wait for a sports car, with RWD, to get back into clutching again.

Its a balanced, rotating assembly. They all make some noise. What is a big difference is the amount of research that goes into insulating the driver from these vibrations.Even the older Hondas have very advanced, active engine mounts designed to dampen the vibration of the engine and mute sounds from the engine compartment (of course these fail over time and are somewhat costly to replace). Additionally, the exhaust note can be engineered as well. Cars like the Miata had extensive research put into optimizing the exhaust note.I don't understand why Ford doesn't sweat the details a little more with respect to NVH and all of these complaints will go away. Improved motor mounts and some additional insulation should solve the problem.Its funny though, I don't mind some mechanical noise. I think that is one of the reasons I like the Subaru so much. I feel part of the driving experience as opposed to isolated from it. "

keeping this on topic, and comparing my wife's Altima VQ 3.5 then to the DT in the Fusion or any other Ford so saddled and disregarding the HP/torque differences. The Altima will rev freely and quickly right up to redline so much so that you almost have to be careful not to bounce off the rev limiter - the Fusion/6, well, you end up just kinda gritting your teeth as the engine strains to meet your demands, the engine is much louder and feels strained. I'm relatively sure it is a function of engine design and balance and engineering expertise, is probably going to need overhead cams, and some sort of method to keep an engine operating at peak efficiences in the higher rev ranges - otherwise known as VVTi (Honda/Nissan/GM 3.6/Hyundai) different than just VVT or CVVTi (Toyota). In essence, the DT has the basic ingredients, but somehow the cake was burned coming out of the oven. I think it is a shame that when Ford, in this case, was making money hand over fist back in the late 90's, that they didn't spend any of it on developing a competitive V6. "

I'm relatively sure it is a function of engine design and balance and engineering expertise, is probably going to need overhead cams,The DT 3.0 is an overhead cam motor. While I think you have the right idea of improving breathing at high RPM, I think your mental model of how variable valve timing technologies work is a little skewed.The i-VTEC in the Accord operates only on the intake. There is a low and high RPM mode, and some component in the rollers allows for additional variation (which is different then the double cam version which allows the cam to operate 25 degrees out of phase). This second system is similar to Toyota's VVTL-I which controls both lift and duration. The Porsche system (vario-cam) I believe primarily affects cam timing with respect to when the valves open, but not the lift and duration. I am ohly familiar with the earlier versions of Vario-cam so its very possible and likely they have modified their system as well. "

Drop it a gear, hit the gas, and it goes, just as well as the VQ.In terms of refinement, both the VQ and DT don't come close to Honda though... "

One of the things I really liked about the older Accord (don't have enough experience with the newer ones to comment) was the tactile feel of the buttons and knobs. Every control had a positive engagement and damped feedback.I contrast this to the Contour, which had less satisfying controls which had hard clicks, although it too, had very positive engagement. The function was there, it just didn't feel as good. I also liked how easy to use the audio systems were in both of those cars.The controls on the Legacy feel very Honda-like, with that damped engagement feeling. It doesn't have the control layout of the older Honda though, and I have to look down activate some features in the Subie (this might be because I don't drive it as much).I think I can summarize refinement for me as the perception of quality in the things I touch when I'm in the car, so that is why I tend to concentrate on switches and controls.I don't mind a bit of drivetrain noise, I like knowing there is an engine up there, so that's not a big issue with me, nor do I need the interior cabin to be a library or mortuary.

I'm happy to offer my take on the qualities that make an engine refined or not.Using my Honda 2.4L inline 4-cylinder as an example of what I consider to be refined... Its as smooth at redline as at 1,000 rpm. Hold the RPMs anywhere in between and it always sounds and feels like it is meant for just that purpose; no vibration, and the tone from the engine and exhaust is nothing but pleasing. It never even gives you the impression that you are working it harder than it wants to. Going to high RPMs is sort of like switching from ""Low"" to ""High"" on my favorite 240-mph electric leafblower, in that it feels like just another setting available for normal use; no drama involved, just a louder ""whoosh"" and more performance when needed. Throttle it up and it lightly growls, then just sings... and you want to do it again. It is a great motor especially considering its in an inexpensive, practical sedan.Now, a motor that is not refined has none of the above qualities. In fact, in many ways it will be opposite. It may be perfectly acceptable under normal conditions, but push it and the sounds are harsh and displeasing, and/or you can almost feel the motor is out of balance, thrashing or vibrating. It doesn't feel like it was made to rev that high. These engines make you feel guilty when you take them to redline, like you are damaging the motor based on how it sounds or feels through the controls. Floor it once, and you'll think ""I don't need to do that again unless I have to."" The impression is that the engine is tearing itself apart to get at those high revs.When driving that DT30 Fusion, I enjoyed the performance, and please don't think I am ""bashing"" or ""hating,"" but I wanted to lift off the throttle well before redline. It did not feel nearly as ""refined."" This, to me, takes away some of the enjoyment of putting an internal combustion engine through its paces. "

To me refined refers not to previous iterations of that make. I use it in comparison to other vehicles. If I think car A is more refined than car B, the sum of its qualities is better than it's competitor. A lot of it will be subjective (interior and exterior appearance, the feel of the controls, handling, etc). Some of it isn't (acceleration, noise, etc). It's really how good a end product it is as a whole from the smallest detail on up.Do the door handles flex when you pull on them? Does the cup holder block the shifter? Does the steering wheel block the instrument cluster? Does the steering communicate to the driver what the car is actually doing? Do potholes make you wonder if parts of your car are falling off? "

don't know if it 'skewed' or not, but not too many years ago we would put grind cams in our engines that effectively would hold intake valves open longer and in a slightly earlier part of the piston stroke, this would allow the engine to suck some more gas (improving breathing), in the process producing more HP and obviously improving 'efficiency. The downside, of course, that loping idle becuase the engine would be less efficient at low rpms. So now we have VVT which is effectively a cam shift that occurs at higher engine speeds that does effectively the same type of thing except that it can also be 'programmed' to occur as deemed necessary by engine loads, fuel octanes etc. - (the Honda VTEC, I believe) The Toyota system takes it quite a bit further, allowing for continuous adjustment on both the intake and exhaust sides again in response to computer readings - allowing for not only some HP, but also effectively 'flattening' out of the torque curve, as well as improved emissions. (CVVTi in their lingo). The DT 3.0 if I'm not mistaken, is mechanical shift only on the intake side and does nothing about lift duration. If this suppostion is correct, don't know if this could conceivably be why the engine is so reticent to rev and/or is relatively HP challenged. You sound like a man that could answer that? "

The only one I hated driving in city traffic, which I do on a daily basis, was the Civic because it had zero low end power. As long as the car has some power and I don't have to rev it up to move a few feet I'm happy. The 6 was FWD and an absolute blast to drive.

Honda continues to build about the best smaller engines on the market but what I was doing was comparing one of the best to perhaps one of the worst. In response to an argument that seemed to imply that that DT in question must be a good or current engine simply because it has 24 valves or multiple OHCs, and/or a rudimentary valve timing system. Those specific engines you mention, the Toyota 3.5, the GM 3.6 are fine examples or the state of the art and in that respect are 'better' (if better, is defined as more current technologically) than the design that Honda is currently using. You forgot BTW the VW 3.6, the MB 3.5 and about every BMW inline 6 ever produced. Point taken, you can point to a whole bunch of engines over the years (the GM 3.8 and more V8s than you can count?) that has served their purposes well, but there remains a vast difference in how a Honda/Nissan/Toyota/Hyundai engine feels and sounds relative to that DT we were talking about) that is not exactly related to how much power each happen to put out.PS I fully expect that it'll be Honda that shortly comes out with some engine superior in almost all respects even to the Toyota 2GR-FSE you mentioned.

Did you drive the 2.3L I4? If so, did you have the same impression of that engine?Yes I have driven the 2.3L I4: normally aspirated in a 2006 Fusion SE manual, and then turbocharged and direct-injected in a 2006 Mazdaspeed Mazda6. In normally aspirated form, I noticed a slight ""buzziness"" to the sound, not entirely displeasing because it reminded me of the 2.2L I4 I had in my first car, a 1991 Mazda 626. Also, when accelerating through the gears, I'd let off the gas completely and push in the clutch, and the RPMs would always jump up by 500. The manual shift knob was huge, and the lever action wasn't very precise (not unlike my 1998 626 ES-V6). As I mentioned before, the Ford/Mazda 2.3L (at least in the midsizers) feels a notch slower than the Camry 2.4L, which is a notch (or two) below the Honda 2.4L. Performance/acceleration numbers seem to bear this out. I'm sure it's more fun in a Mazda3 or Focus. Bottom line, I wouldn't call this motor ""unrefined,"" it was quite happy to buzz along. I just wanted more grunt from my 4-banger.In turbo form, the motor was a real hoot. Tons of torque, but power started to drop off above about 4,800 RPM.

The dealer we bought from had an internet price of $1800 below INVOICE. There was a general $1,000 rebate and another $1,000 rebate if financed through Hyundai Finance (5.9% for 60 months)We also qualified for the owner loyalty rebate of $500. Our price for the car, before doc + ttl, was $4300 under invoice or $5429 below MSRP. The resale value game is a shell game. Trade-in value or retail value of a used car? I just saw Enterprise rent-a-car offering a comparably equipped '06 Sonata with 14,692 miles for $17,999 and they say, ""blue book retail value"" of $20,690. Enterprise is a ""no haggle"" price. "

Thank you, exactly what I'm talking about, with many of the other cars in this group, you don't have the time to ""want to lift off the throttle"" Now, I certainly don't think the Fusion is slow when you get the V6. The DT30 may not like to rev high, but that 6-speed automatic is pretty good for a slushbox, and it makes up for it (I've always like Aisin-built trannys, had one in a Cherokee that was bulletproof). Once out of first gear, the transmission kept the motor on the boil. As I mentioned, it just didn't seem very ""refined"" (see previous definition) when doing so. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'd prefer that it be smoother as opposed to more eager to rev, because overall not that slow of a car. 7.2 seconds? Most V6's these days are quicker. The Mazda6 with the same motor and equipped with a manual isn't quicker because it only has 5 speeds versus 6 in the Auto. Some of the faster four cylinders in this class (Accord, Altima) can keep up when equipped with manuals. Decent performance.Can't really use much more than that around here. My wife wants a new Mustang GT. I drove one for a couple of days last year. This was the drill: gas it in first to get going good, short-shift, give it some gas in second. You're now going 10-15 mph over the speed limit. Shift to 5th.  Otherwise, I'd get in a lot of trouble. Insurance was too high on it to begin with. "

The parallel you draw to reground cams with lumpy idles is a pretty good analogy to the high end cam profiles. It basically improves high end breathing, but does so without affect the low end torque and drivablilty.The original VTEC of the early 90s was variable cam timing, while later versions also affected lift (there is a component on the roller). I believe they can now do duration as well (i-vtec). Toyota skipped the early versions and showed up late with timing, duration and lift.Remarkably, the next leap might be GM with getting rid of the cam altogether.Again, the parallel to the lumpy cams is also seen in the aftermarket as a number of companies make ""vtec controllers"" that vary the rpms where they activate, etc. "

Most V6's these days are quicker. The Mazda6 with the same motor and equipped with a manual isn't quicker because it only has 5 speeds versus 6 in the Auto.The number of gears isn't the issue, its the final drive ratio and the individual gear ratios, as well as top speed in gears. Manual transmission cars that are geared super short are slower because they have to be in 3rd to hit 60, while some of the taller cars can do 60 in 2nd. The time to shift is a factor here (I know don't get started on DSGs and what not, take it to the manual trans forum). "

I didn't say the Fusion or the 6 were slow, acceleration is a function of HP and at 200+ HP they both will be reasonably quick although slower than most of the other V6 cars in this group. If the Fusion, for example, is going to get to 60 in 7 seconds, it's more about how it feels and sounds when you ask it to really do it. Manuals will almost always be quicker and more economical than autos simply because there are less mechanical losses. More speeds in the tranny is fashionable right now but is more likely to improve FE than improve acceleration, it kinda depends on how the gear ratios are matched to the operating characteristics of the engine and how wide the engine's torque curve is. The bigger Avalon 5 speed is every bit as quick as the 6 speed Camry and the FE ratings are also the same, somewhat a testimony to the flexibility of the engine they now share. "

I'd assume the Mazda6 V6 6A would be pretty much the same (basically same chassis, motor and transmission, roughly the same weight). Now the Mazda6 V6 5M doesn't break into the 6's does it? I've always read they are in the low 7's.I found this on Consumer Guide, regarding the 2006 models: ""The i versions are acceptably peppy with manual transmission, sluggish with automatic. V6s lively, but need high rpm for maximum punch. Test manual s sedan did 7.5 sec 0-60 mph."" Even if you can flog one barely under 7, that's still not really much faster than the 6A at just over 7. We're talking 10ths of a second.I could be wrong. My 1998 626 ES-V6 was good for 7.2 0-60. It only had 170hp (by the old standards) but was light by todays standards and geared very, very low (5th gear at 80mph was 4,000 RPM!). I miss that car...

I've heard that it's not so much ""de-powered"" as just using different metrics to measure power - specifically using SAE standards. To those who keep calling the Mazda 6 engine ""antiquated"", ""rough"", and ""thrashy"", perhaps the less-exagerated way of putting it is ""not as smooth"" or ""not as quiet"" or ""not as efficient"" as some other engines in this class. Remember, this engine/car continues to garner awards like most desired by editors of Edmunds in 2007, sportiest car by consumers digest in 2007, and one of the most desireable cars in Esquire magazine for 2006. Given these awards, it can't be as bad as you describe... As an analogy, since the Accord is slightly behind the Sonata in JD Powers reliablity reports, perhaps you'd say the Accord is junk? I'd say that this is also an exageration that doesn't stand to reason. Ok, the 6's engine isn't the best, the newest, the quietest, the most efficient, or even the most desireable... but it's still a good enough engine that propels the Mazda 6 to garner a great deal of respect by many auto journalists (who arguably are some of the most passionate people when it comes to cars...after all they have dedicated their livelihoods to that passion!). As a sidenote, I've spent quite a bit of time with the Subaru boxter engine. With a turbo, that thing makes the legacy exhilarating. But since it's relatively quiet on the inside, it hides how clackity that engine is. Perhaps because the older 6's (I think the 06's and newer are a bit quieter than my 05) didn't have as much sound deadening material as the legacy, it makes the duratec sound less refined than others because you can hear more of it. Personally, I find reving the 6's engine up quite rewarding and not at all objectionable... so to each, their own. As to the 2.3 engine that the 6 has, Motor trend described that engine as follows: ""Mazda's four-cylinder version of the 6--the i--is a willing partner on these curvy roads: a free-revving 2.3-liter, 160-horsepower inline-four joined to a snicky five-speed manual and a driver-focused cockpit, all wrapped in far-spicier-than-vanilla bodywork.... Like its Camry and Accord competitors, the 6i is no rocket off the line, but once the tach tops 3000 rpm, the DOHC powerplant comes on strong, delivering an enthusiastic pull. The standard five-speed manual is one of the most positive shifters around, though we long for another cog. And, yes, you can heel/toe downshift in this family car.The 6 is a joy on curvy roads, quickly taking a set with minimal understeer and negligible bump steer--not something you expect to find in the four-cylinder midsize-sedan category. Mazda thoughtfully includes grippy and supportive bucket seats in the open-feeling interior, which is designed with large, strategically placed knobs, dials, and switches.""So yeah, the 6's engines aren't class leaders. But they don't deserve to be dogged either. In the end, they are solid components that don't detract from those who value a vehicle that is both comfortable and fun. "

I have often read about how the MZ6 has ""only"" 220 hp. My how times have changed. When the Taurus SHO came out in 1989 it had 220 hp and was lauded as an extremely fast sedan; 140 mph top speed. Now almost any sedan can be had with more than 220 hp. Where are we using all this extra horsepower?

The thing is, many of the high-horsepower cars are getting some of the best mileage estimates (compare the Altima 4-cylinder to the rest of the 4-cylinder class, it has best economy AND acceleration.) The Camry V6 is the same way.Awkwardly however, the vehicles that are lower on power also seem to offer less fuel economy, with the exception of the GM 3.5L pushrod, which does quite well for an engine of its size economywise, although power is only modest.

There are other exceptions as well. Chrysler's 2.7 and 3.5 V6 engines get exceptional fuel economy as well. I've owned both sizes and used them for business travel. My last two, both Sebring 2.7 sedans, consistently got 30 - 32 MPG running 75 on interstates. I also have owned a Dodge intrepid 2.7 and a Chrysler LHS with the 3.5 - both got exceptional mileage for as big as they were. I've also owned 2 Accords, both 4 bangers with manuals, and, neither of them delivered the fuel economy that the Chryslers do. My all - time fuel economy champ remains a 1975 Oldsmobile Starfire with a 3.8 V6 with a two barrel and a 3 speed automatic. The car consistently gave me 38+ MPG.

Odd that you got poor mileage in your Accords. I get 38-40 MPG on strictly highway in my 2006 Accord, and that's with an automatic at 70 MPH. The old one, a 1996, will return 31 MPG at that speed, with A/C. Not bad for a 4-speed that turns 2,800 RPM at 70 MPH.We have had to Chryslers, one with a 2.4L 4-cyl (Sebring) and one with the 2.7L. Both cars had transmission issues (refusing to back up on many occasions), and the second one (2.4L) had suspension issues that confused the dealer for 4 months. A horrible creaking/groaning that they heard but could never find. My family traded the car with 35k miles, since the warrany was about to expire and we knew we'd be upside down in repair bills soon after that occurred. I remember the 2.4L was pathetically powered for that car, with something between 11 and 12 seconds to 60 MPH. The Sebring convertible is a HEAVY car. I can't say I remember the mileage they returned (these were some years ago).And yes, I think ""[non-permissible content removed] cars"" as you call them are reliable as a whole. My other daily driver is a 1996 Accord LX with 172,000 miles on it. Hasn't left me stranded a day in its life (which started in my family in November of 1995). Pretty reliable to me. So was my granddad's 260k mile Civic which he sold for $1,000. Not saying other cars aren't reliable though, just that our ""[non-permissible content removed] cars"" have been the epitomy of reliable transportation, and that I've seen no evidence that tells me my Accord should be any different.

Thanks for your impressions of the 2.3, benderofbows. I did not really drive the Mazda6 with Ford's V6 enough to form much of an impression of it.

Now that engine really makes you worry when it revs. OTOH, these ""antiquated"" pushrod engines seem to generate lots of low end torque...225 ft-lbs at only 3000 rpm in that 3.8L, which is also satisfying in its own way.

as being illustrated by many of these new V6s - with the increased efficiencies (HP) also comes the increased FE. The two seem to go together. The Toyota 2GR-FS, which I have argued is the most advanced in this group, was originally rated at 280HP (pre the 06 SAE changes) - added 500cc of displacement, some torque, about 80 HP, and a coupla three mpg. From Toyota's standpoint, if they can produce something that wins both the HP and FE 'wars' they would be foolish not to - because both SELL. Besides which, for those folks that put a high priority on FE, the 4 bangers and the hybrids are available. A can't lose situation for the auto buyer? "

The key word there is ""Strictly"" highway. That means, I fill up at a gas station along the interstate (my usual trips put me on I-65), and fill up within a couple of miles of getting off the interstate. Once I hit my steady speed (70-75 MPG typically), I usually go the ENTIRE trip without ever summoning a downshift, so revs stay at a constant 2,400 or so. These trips were in cooler months with no A/C as well, and never more than two of us in the car. A/C seems to knock 1 MPG off of my regular numbers.So, conditions were very conducive to excellent mileage. My typical mileage on my regular route is 29-30 MPG, with 14 miles of interstate, 12 miles of two-lane/four-lane streets. Conservative acceleration is common (rarely topping 3,500 RPM except when I want a grin ). My dad had a car similar to mine (a 2005 version of the same car), and drove much more aggressively, and in return, averaged about 5 MPG less than I would get on trips. He is constantly summoning a downshift to pass or accelerate, though. Driving style is HUGE in mileage.I'm planning a trip to Oklahoma again soon, and will report on the mileage I get on that 1,500 mile trip. It'll be hot (May) and the car will be loaded. "

Dropping a gear to pass on the highway is almost TOO easy, and fun BTW!(That's the only disagreement I have with your post, my Accord 4-cyl is considerably faster than the Mazda6/Fusion 2.3L, at mid-7 seconds versus low-9 seconds to 60).A slight correction. The low-9 seconds to 60 MPH that you refer to is for the Mazda 6 with the 2.3L and automatic. With the manual, I believe you're looking at mid- to high-7s, same as the V6 with automatic.When it comes right down to it, all else equal, I'd take better performance for slightly less ""refinement."" ... Would I also be happy with a 6? Of course.I like how you think.  I bought my 6 in '04, after repeatedly test-driving it, an Accord coupe (V6, 5-speed manual), an Altima 3.5SE (V6, 5-speed manual), and a Legacy GT (limited with manual). In the end, each had it's flaws, but the 6 won me over on the not-so-bad V6 power, excellent handling, great styling and an inexpensive price. The Accord was smooth, powerful, and styled nicely, but the 2-door is impractical for me, and at the time, the only V6, 5-speed manual combo from the factory was the coupe (but yes, I know it's available on the 4-door now.) The Altima wasn't bad. Excellent power with the V6, but the body-roll while cornering almost gave me motion-sickness. The torque-steer was terrible, especially during cornering, and the interior was cheap-looking and cheap-feeling to me. Apparently, the '08s have fixed all that, but I haven't driven one yet.The Legacy had AWD, but you can feel it's extra weight from the instant you hit the gas. The 4-cyl was okay, but I know I'd get terrible gas mileage with the AWD. And I could never get comfortable in the driver's seat, no matter what position I tried.I assume you have a 6? Want to trade cars for a weekend?I do. And no, sorry!  "

4000 rpm for 80? 4 banger territory these days and would be actually be high for any of the V6s in this group. My 2GR Toyota with a 5 speed auto is at 2700 for 80 mph and would suggest to you that some of those 'old' 3.8s are turning even less than that.I forgot to mention, that motor was a screamer! Redline was 7,000 RPM, but it would readily and willingly surpass that- I was a couple of hundred RPMs into it by accident a few times and the rev limiter never interfered, and this one time...My wife will KILL me if she ever sees this, but... When driving a stick she used to get nervous and try to do everything too fast, even though I taught her it doesn't matter how slow you operate the clutch and gear shifter, always better to take your time.One late, late night she was driving it and merging onto an empty highway. She ran it out pretty high in first gear, shifted very quick to second and ran it out to make the jump into 3rd... and instead, went right back into first and dropped the clutch. Talk about a motor ""screaming"" !!! I couldn't see exactly from the passenger seat but it was WAAAAAY in the red, over 7,500 RPMs. I can still hear the sound. Maybe the limiter finally stepped in and saved my butt that time, lol.But everything was fine, no ill effects. It had almost 100,000 miles on it at that point, too. It's still ticking along somewhere I'm sure, the last time I spoke to the guy I sold it to he had no complaints. Take that 3.8 above 7,500 and see what happens! "

That's only a few grand more than my Accord was. But, insurance and speeding tickets would have been much, much more I can't restrain myself well. It's more fun for me to run my Accord 4-cylinder hard than it was for me to drive that 2005 Mustang GT (which I had from a local dealer for two days when the wife wanted to upgrade) because of having to refrain from taking advantage of the power. You could floor it in one gear and that was it, fun was over or you're looking at a BIG TIME ticket or accident.

sorry I guess I misunderstood what you were calling 'low'. But, in any case, I find it hard to believe that any V6 especially one with a Ford label, would run out past 7000 rpm. If so, it certainly can't be related to the 3.0 DT. The 2GR Toyota has a 6500 redline, the tranny will hold right to redline with any sort of encouragement, so much so, that you find yourself bouncing off the rev limiter simply because it (the rev increase) is so transparent and quick. As far as that 3.8 at 7500 - can you say schrapnel?  "

Hey thegraduate,I've noticed that my 2006 Accord SE 4 auto. has gotten better mpg. I bought the car last June new and it has about 12,000 miles. Starting at about 7,000 miles the car consistently rewarded me with over 30 miles to the gallon (Over 33 miles on one trip to Monterey, CA and going over 450 miles before the light came on). I use the car primarily on the freeway with trips about 70 miles or so. At times in some streches, its stop and go on the freeway and speed no higher than 25.As far as the new, 2008 Accord, the vtec.net site had some good information about the 4s and 6s (albeit perhaps highly speculative). I don't think Honda will increase the hp of the 4 by that much though - usually its 10. Look for a boost in fuel economy and additional safety items. "

The 4 banger accords gave me less than expected mileage because I live in the mountains. I had to constantly downshift to maintain interstate speeds, especially if I was carrying passengers and luggage.Never said the Chryslers were reliable - my last 2 have been terrible, but, they do get great gas mileage.My experience with Japanese cars - my first Accord was great, the second was a lemon. Two of my kids bought Civics, and, with much interstate driving, the engines in both were pretty much shot by 90K. My other kid has tried a Toyota MR2, a Nissan Sentra, and a Hyundai Excel. The MR2 and the Sentra were money pits, but, the Hyundai went 146K with minimal repairs. Do I think Toyotas and Hondas are reliable - Sure, but, I've also gotten similar reliabilty out of most of the Ford, GM, and Chrysler cars I've owned.

I had to constantly downshift to maintain interstate speeds, especially if I was carrying passengers and luggage. Ah, that makes perfect sense. Hondas aren't known well for low-end torque for good reason; until lately, they simply didn't have much of it. Top end power was plentiful in most models, but below 3,000 RPM, not a whole lot would typically go on. This is true in my 1996 Accord (although my 2006 is plenty torquey with peak torque a good deal lower than the older models as well). You probably get the best mileage out of high-torque, lower hp engines in your conditions. In mine, the Honda balance works much better. "

The Accord could easily overtake the Camry when the all-new Accord debuts later this year. The current model is five years old; the Camry was recently redesigned. Also, the Camry's numbers include a large number of sales to fleets; almost all the Accord's numbers are to individuals. The limitation with the Accord will be production, as you noted.Hyundai has deliberately cut back on Sonata sales to fleets this year, so that is part of the reason for the dropoff from last year, when many Sonatas went into fleets. Also, incentives have been lower so far this year than last year, when they were $3000 total for most of the year on V6 models.The Prius has had incentives for the first time recently, and $3.00+ a gallon gas doesn't hurt Prius sales either.Malibu numbers should pick up later this year also, when the all-new and improved Malibu comes out.

That's why I think repeated short distance drives are the reason my exhaust didn't last very long (5-6 years).Hondas are the only cars I've been responsible for where I had to replace an exhaust system.Its not a killer expense, its not going to make me love one brand and hate another, but its interesting.

What amazes me is the Accord can still sell 36,000 units with a wheezing design and style. Unbelievable market acceptance. When the 08 Accord debuts - watch out. might have something to do with huge rebates you can get on them. If they can maintain their 17% or so increases selling at sticker..............then that will be something. and toyota might have to watch out.and, I wouldn't call the design or style wheezing. I think the current sales may be a testament to how ahead of its time the last redesign was. "

The cat, or any other part of the exhaust, was never changed in 12 years, and 140k miles. Only the parts farthest from the heat of the engine, where the moisture took longer to evaporate. The metal termites are having a feast on my Chevy truck exhaust, because I drive less than one mile to and from work twice a day. But I'm not exactly going to drive around town for 5 more miles (burning more gas), to save my exhaust. "

Well, since short trips have a harmful effect on the muffler, the fact that the car ran 35 mile trips, twice a day, five days a week, for 6 years (and 115k miles of its life), probably has something to do with it.

thats because the accord is a better car than the fussion, period. The accord, however, is going to run you 3k+ more to buy. and that will probably increase quite a bit when the 2008 accords show up. And I doubt its ever going to change. Ford is just more concerned about their trucks than anything else. You never find outdated engines or technology in them. They're constantly investing time, money, and engineering skill on improving the F seris truck, and as a result, are by far the best truck you can buy.But when it comes to cars, ford just isn't as concerned. At least not in north america. If it hadn't been for the run up in gas prices, and the resulting double digit decreases in truck/suv sales, ford would still be a comfortable #2 in the auto industry.

As has been mentioned, miles are not really much of a factor in exhaust system life. Time and short trips are the bigger factors, I would think the climate can have an effect too, as it takes longer to heat everything up in cold weather.Are there differences in the quality of exhaust systems? We had an '89 Voyager, the exhaust system was still good at the end of the vehicles life (12 years) and we do have winter here in WI. Kids have '95 and '96 Contours. The '95 had one pipe replaced and the '96 had the resonator replaced.In contrast a '91 Nissan Sentra we used to have, needed a lot of exhaust system work done to it over time. Reminded me of the old days, when a new exhaust system every 3 years seemed typical.I have assumed that by now, these midsize cars have all stainless exhaust. Is this a correct assumption...does anyone know od exceptions to that? Also are there perhaps differences in the quality of the stainless steel used? "

I wonder how many people in this discussion (v1.0) beat up Hyundai for selling too many Sonatas to fleets, and now are beating them up because they have reduced sales to fleets in an attempt to raise transaction prices and improve resale values.Keep in mind also that with Santa Fes selling briskly, around 8500 last month (more than a 100% increase over last year), Sonata production for the North American market (in the Alabama plant) is gated at about 25,000 per month less Santa Fe production. So that puts a limit of about 16,000 on Sonatas per month, less if Hyundai increases Santa Fe production to meet growing demand. The Sonata will not come close to outselling the likes of Accord, Camry, and Altima in the forseeable future; there simply aren't enough Sonatas available. Maybe Hyundai could ship some from the ROK if needed, but it appears they are working on increasing transaction prices and per-unit profit than on maxing out production.If the Sonata is an inferior car because it sells ""only"" 11,000 per month in the U.S., I guess that makes low-volume cars like the Mazda6 and Legacy really bad!

I'm not arguing that the Fusion is ""better"" than the Accord, or vice versa. But higher sales numbers do not equal ""better."" I would also suggest that you are no more of an expert of what ""better"" is than I when it comes to cars for other people. Consumers are pretty funny, if you ask me. Often times consumers go into a store without doing any research or even knowing what characteristics are important to them. Sometimes consumers focus on one characteristic without conisdering other important ones. All this is just saying that just because someone buys something, it does not necessarily mean that what they bought was the ""best"" choice for them. The process of buying a car is complicated and tiring which many people find very stressful. Under these conditions, it's no wonder why someone may buy something that is not ideal.

The Sonata was the car that, when introduced, bested the Camry in multiple comparos. (The Altima available at that time wasn't deemed worthy to even participate in those comparos.) More than a shot over the bow of Toyota and Nissan, I'd say. And they have responded with better designs in the past year. And you may have noticed that since the '06 Sonata was introduced, huge discounts with Honda-to-dealer incentives have been available on Accords. Coincidence? Or maybe some people have figured out that an Accord isn't worth $5000+ more than a Sonata, so Honda has had to adjust their market pricing to compensate.As for how many Gen 3 Sonatas were sold in prior Marches, in 2005 11,373 were sold (best ever for the Sonata up to that time) due in large part to huge close-out incentives right before the new Sonata was released; in March 2004, 8,736 were sold; in March 2003, 7550 were sold, and in March 2002 (the first year for the refreshed Gen 3 Sonata) 5725 were sold. So 11,000 is on the high end for monthly sales for the Sonata--as high as the best sales month ever for the prior generation. "

The fact that Honda has incentives on the Accord is no surprise given the fact that its five model years old. Also, they typically had incentives (not cash rebates) on the Accords towards the end of the model year, as did the previous version of the Camry, and the 2006 Sonata.Its a fact that the dated Accord continues to be at or near the top of this segment. The 2008 Accord retail prices are not expected to rise that much. perhaps less than 3%, or a few hundred dollars and standard content will increase. I would not go out any buy one right away when they are introduced because you will not likely receive a large discount. Perhaps, wait until mid to late December of 2007 to get a pretty significant discount. This segment of the market is too competitive. I bet you that many of those competitor cars have rebates/dealer incentives/special leases and finance rates on them come that time. Also, you can get a 2007 Camry CE or LE 4 in my locale for a rather signifcant savings off of MSRP. Why? Although the vehicle is selling well - its nearing the end of the model year and the market is too crowded. "

I think most people don't know about Hyundai. Many that do, just remember the negatives from the late '80's. Probably over 90% of car buyers have never taken a close look at a Hyundai, never mind a test drive. I wouldn't say there are being fooled or are brain washed but, perhaps, maybe foolish for not taking a close look at Hyundai (and other makes) to see what is available in the market now. Good luck with a brand helps build owner loyalty (heck, Hyundai often offers a loyalty rebate). Honda & Toyota have been building great cars for 20+/- years now. Hyundai started building great cars in '99 or 2000. It will take them a while to gain widespread acceptance. They are slowly attracting more attention and buyers. Counting myself, I know three Hyundai drivers who, following conventional wisdom, wouldn't have looked at a Hyundai 3 years ago (actually one of them is picking up his new Azera Wednesday). "

The competition has increased from the 1980's when Accords used to sell at a price higher than MSRP in CT. Whether manufacturer to dealer or manufacturer to consumer, Honda has felt a need to offer incentives. And, as you said, they typically had incentives towards the end of the model year. Years ago they did not. I think rebates to the consumer are better for the consumer as he is sure to get the rebate. Incentives to the dealer are not ""always"" 100% passed along to the consumer.  If a manufacturer offers dealers a $1500 incentive but only $700 of the incentive reaches the consumer that could help the resale value, but the consumers would have been ""shorted"" $800 up front. Which would you rather have $800 today or $800 extra when you dispose of the car in a few years? "

There are pluses and minuses to either one - rebate or incentives. Rebates are taxable in CA and dealer incentives are not. Rather, rebates are used to offset the purchase price plus all add-ons, taxes, doc fees,license/registration, etc. figure, as are cash you contribute and/or trade-in. You have to be smart to get most/all of the dealer incentives - but the dedicated Prices Paid Forums really help. They are likely to pass on the entire dealer incentive amount - since there is a 3% holdback on a Honda.I remember Accords always being discounted here in CA since the late 1980s.

I think the Sonata is a nice looking car. I like the styling of it as much as the Accord. It looks to me like the visibility is a bit better from the inside of the Sonata, because the rear roof pillars aren't as thick as they are on the Accord. Also, look at the features you get on even the base level Sonata--XM Radio (can't get that on the Accord until you go to the exl), stability control (can't get that unless you get the V6), etc.. I love xm radio (which I have as an aftermarket unit on my 02 Accord), and it seems like the advantages of stability control outweigh the disadvantages.And so far, the people who own the Sonata seem to like it.

Let me clarify what I said earlier: these incentives and deals on the Accord didn't just start appearing in the past few months, on 5-year-old Accords (design-wise). They have been around for about 2 years. Coinciding with the arrival of the '06 Sonata, the first truly competitive mid-sized offering from Hyundai. I don't think it was a coincidence.It will be interesting to see what happens if Honda drops incentives on the 2008 Accords and dealers try to sell them at or near MSRP, especially if MSRP goes up. Then it will be back to a $5000-6000+ difference between the Sonata/Optima and the Accord, if Hyundai/Kia maintain current levels of incentives. "

Then there's the 5 year roadside service and features of each car.We just bought an '07 Sonata SE w/XM for $3357 LESS than Edmund's TMV. What is the street price of a comparable ACCORD? We may be looking at a real price difference of $5,000 or more right now. If the comparable Honda is the LX V-6, Edmunds says the TMV is $24,282 and there is a $750 to dealer incentive. If 100% of the incentive is granted to the consumer, the TMV price would be $23,532. If I compare our actual Sonata purchase price to the TMV for the Accord, I'm looking at a savings of $6481 for the Sonata. Are Accords selling below TMV? If so, by how much? "

That wouldn't surprise me, either. Few things do these days. However, the mid-sized market is a different than it was in the fall of 2002, when the current Accord design debuted. Back then, you had the Camry, Altima, and then-new Mazda6 as clear-cut front-runners in the class. The competition is much stiffer now, with new-for-2007 Camry and Altima still there; the Aura, Fusion, Legacy, and Milan; the Sonata and Optima; the Passat; and all-new Mazda6 and Malibu due for 2008. So if Honda tries pricing the Accord too high, there are lots of good alternatives for price-conscious buyers. "

I try not to get personal. I deal with that way too much and I have many wounds to prove it. The 08' Accord, I think will indeed be a nice car. I like the pics I see as it finally has character. I being a former Acura TL, owner (a mistake) did like the product very much but hated the service. I however do think a SH-AWD Acura TL, would be a hit. It will need enough power to overcome the AWD problem if they aren't going to make it a RWD car. I think it would be more popular as a SH-AWD car anyways but it's going to have to come in with plenty of power and have the ""gadgetology"" to once again become a class leader. We will see.....This fall the best mid-size automobile even though I's perfer the Holden grill is the RWD Pontiac G8. If they make a HSV version of this car like they do in Australia, their isn't another non-lux car out on the market that will touch it's handling and power. It's basically a street legal race car in HSV trim. I however won't expect to see a HSV for a year or two. Acura, right now has the best chance to meet the G8's power. They better not under estimate the G8's impact on their own sales. I still think Acura, would be best to Twin-Turbo their V6 to make the power. Like I said we will see as more and more sporty and luxury cars hit this segment. The new Mazda6 and Mazdaspeed 6 is coming. Of course we have the Spec. B Subie. The RWD Impala in 2009. How bout the 2010 Buick Velite Sedan ? I'm just saying it's going to be a crowded field as more and more offerings hit the midsize segment. Rocky "

these incentives and deals on the Accord didn't just start appearing in the past few months, on 5-year-old Accords (design-wise). They have been around for about 2 years. Not according to Edmunds and other sources. There was no dealer incentive when I bought my Accord in March of 06. They started soon after, however,  "

Manufacturers only offer discounts for one reason, and one reason only. To sell more cars. There is a variety of reasons why they want to sell more cars, such as clearing space for new models, or reaching some sales goal ect. they don't start handing out 1500 dollars to buyers just because the design is old. a $1500 rebate reduces the profit to almost nothing on a camry, altima, accord, or similar mid size sedan.the same will hold true if buying a car at the end of the year. If for example, you want an altima and they're still selling 25-30% over last years numbers, good luck getting a rebate. If nissan can sell them without one, they aren't going to offer one. ditto for any other car. If you want a rebate on a good selling car, you'll have to wait till jan, or feb, of '08 when they will want all the 07 cars off the lot. "

Sounds like sour grapes to me. I don't interpret it as bashing anything non-Honda, more like crowing cause the Accord is that good, even being a 6 year old model. Why take a chance on a Ford (weak reputation) or a Hyundai (unproven to the masses) when you can just buy an Accord and rest easy?Considering this post blatantly breaks the guidelines established in the first post:Well, duh, it's about midsize sedans.

Not all of these incentives to dealers are public knowledge. Dealers can choose to pass them along to buyers or apply them to their profits. For example, if you look at Edmunds.com now for incentives on the Accord, what do you see? Awhile ago, Hyundai was offering manufacturer-to-dealer incentives on the Sonata, and these didn't show up at Edmunds.com either. "

Since this discussion frequently strays into a ""Honda equals a no-brainer choice that even an automotive dim-wit can buy without regret or fear"" sort of mindset I'll give an opposing opinion. We bought our first ever Honda product, a 2006 Civic EX sedan automatic, in Nov 2005. It has had both rear shocks replaced at about 4K miles but the rear suspension noise that resulted from leaking shocks started on the drive home from the dealer @ 6 miles showing. It has had two (of about a dozen potential bulletins for the 06 Civic alone) service bulletins applied, both for abnormal noises. The second required replacement of the right upper motor mount. The interior plastics used are of terrible quality, particularly on the door trim where the door pull/arm rest is. It is a ""waffle"" pattern that scratches easily and irrevocably. The pattern in the cloth on the driver seat bolster has begun to disappear (as in wear off)and the fabric itself is bunching up on that same bolster. The car has excessive wind/road noise. On the other hand fuel economy is fairly good on the road and we have not had any driving issues except for the interior noise and the 5 speed auto that shifts out of 5th into 4th at the very thought of an incline not to mention a hill. I am not entirely happy with Honda and yes,I was one of those who went into this with that Honda = quality mindset. How did I get that? print media (all those golden articles in all those car and consumer magazines) and word of mouth (ask ANY Honda owner it never breaks). The car currently has 7,358 miles not a typo 7 thousand miles. I previously owned (and several in our family still own)Hyundai products which by comparison were and are trouble free at 10 to 20X the mileage of the Honda. I am a lone voice in the wilderness.... "

They are paying more for the Accord because the media has beat it into thier heads that it is worth it when it is not. The Fusion is by far a better value, costing thousands less. A .5 second difference?? is a whole lot faster?? can you count to a 1/2 second??? This room is turning into a joke. Once again the Honda fans get to bash away at the Fusion/Sonata or anyone else that differs on their opinion. I have threads taken off that are not near as bad as are posted on here! -Scape, I'll further support my case by asking you to look more closely at the performance numbers. In the Car & Driver article I referenced ""The Quickest Cars of 2007: Less than $20,000,"" they clock the Accord 0-60 in 7.5 seconds. In the same article, the Mazda3 s, being smaller/lighter than the Fusion but having the saving engine, beats the Accord to 60 by 0.2 seconds.However, look at the ""street start"" 5-60 mph numbers. In my opinion, this is a good measure of an engines' usable torque and makes a big difference in throttle response around town or in traffic. The Mazda3 s, although faster than the Accord 0-60, is SLOWER than the Accord from 5-60 by 0.8 seconds! (Accord 7.9 versus Mazda3 8.7 5-60 mph).The 5-60 time of the Accord is only 0.1 second off from the faster, more powerful, 6-speed manual Altima! I think that's noteworthy.According to C&D, the Fusions ""street start"" time is 9.0 seconds, or over a second slower than the Accord. That is a difference you can really feel when driving both cars. AGAIN, does that mean I am ""bashing away"" at the Fusion? No! Most people don't care too much how quick their car will respond to throttle inputs. I'm just here to talk and compare midsize sedans. Can we do that? You are right, the Fusion is a great value, of course the resale value is less so it roughly evens out. "

Since this discussion frequently strays into a ""Honda equals a no-brainer choice that even an automotive dim-wit can buy without regret or fear"" sort of mindset I'll give an opposing opinionNo, your not the only one who feels that way. I know a civic is not an accord, but i was so unimpressed with my civic i never even seriously considered the accord when i made my last purchase. I pretty much was picking between the camry and altima. And to be fair, the civic runs great (although I do have to fork out the $$$ for the timing belt change that I never have to with chained nissans) but the interior is just so cheap, and poorly constructed that I wasn't even going to take a chance with the accord. I still can't believe the mid level trim came with a tape player instead of cd. But the problems you described are spot on. the damn texture to the plastics, inaddition to the scratching problem) are a pain in the [non-permissible content removed] to keep clean. and the cloth on the door pannel fell off durring year two. just a cheap glue holding it on.And as I said, I know the accord is of much higher quality than both the civic and competition in its class. The catch, though, is the price. Out of all the midsize sedans out there, the accord is always the most expensive......and usally several thousand more. Sure, they're rebating the hell out of 'em now, and sales are way up. But, I'd be willing to bet when the 08's show up, the price rises, and the rebates dissapear; you won't get one off the lot for less than 23-24k. For any who doubt, look at the civic. redisgned in 06, much better, nicer car, and much more expensive. At my local honda dealer, the base models are starting at about 18,300. as a result, its the most expensive compact in market, and sales (so far this year) are down about 15% "

It is a circular argument. The media ALWAYS says that Honda is golden in all manner of ways and the American auto shopper sees, reads, believes and buys the NEW Honda (much like I did) thus keeping resale up because the media says Honda is golden and the perspective USED car buyer also sees, reads, believes, and wants..you guessed it..a used Honda. How do you think this determined ""worth"" comes about? It starts with good press. If you think the media (consumer and auto test magazines stating Honda is GOOD)don't have any effect on the ""worth"" of a used Accord/Civic etc. or conversely any relatively negative comments about a Ford product have a ""less than positive"" effect on the resale of that Ford product you are incorrect.

BTW if and when Honda makes a car that does not live up to expectations, that 'perception' honeymoon you are talking about will become a 20 year marriage, prices will go down, as will scape's 'value'.I believe, that in general, the Fusion is viewed pretty favorably, perhaps the 'best' Ford product out there, which is definitely a relative consideration. Again, IMPO, I might look at it seriously once they can improve their engines and stop supporting the Mexican economy.

So, therefore, an ascending graph as the vehicle ages - Toyota/Honda/Nissan showing about half the number of problems thru the years than the 'US' mfgrs- apparently based on several hundred thousand responses to their questionnaires over the years. The Fusion, incidentally, has been doing pretty well, but hasn't been around long enough to be able to tell if it will continue to show good results over the long term or will become more like the 'usual' Ford. Same sort of situation right now for Hyundai and the new Sonata BTW, because history does not support that mfgr. making cars to the same sort of levels that the 'Japan 3' has. 5 years from now, who knows, we may find out that the 05 Fusion is exactly what scape says it is - it may be the first 'bulletproof' Ford ever made.

The media plays a huge role in perception as to what a car is worth to the consumer. If we are told over and over and over again that an Accord/Camry is the ""best"" then yes people will fork out more $$ for it. It is going to take the consumer some time to realize Honda or Toyota do make good cars. But they are not worth the extra premium price. However, lets look again at the Car and Driver comparison of the 3 vehicles. What some here fail to see is this is a comparison done by consumers, not one person like a review by a magazine that needs to keep its sales up. The mag is going to take the easy route with the sedan that is selling the most vehicles. These test hosted by Car and Driver and yes, paid by Ford were everyday people like you and I. Unlike a bias review from one ""expert"" that must keep the masses happy to keep sales of the magazine up. This comparison test is very significant.For me, the Fusion was by far the better value, better car than a like optioned Camry or Accord. It handles like its on rails. As far as road noise it matches the Accord/Camry in Db levels. Granted, you romp on the gas and it does get a little noisier than an Accord or Camry. "

Honestly, I wouldn't pay any attention to those at all. The reason the camry is so high is because they are probably the most honest. the reverse would be true for nissan. The cost of ownership is one of them most minupulated figures out there. To get a lower number, the manufacturer will simply push back the maintanence intervals. for instance, how many people have bought cars where the owners manual says to change the oil every 7500 miles? and to cover their butts, they add that line that if you drive under more severe conditions (never defined though) that you should bump up time/milage intervals.

I don't know that I do. If you look at the prices posted about 2 years ago, there are some great deals there. But it's very possible that incentives have increased recently as the current Accord nears the end of its life. That doesn't change the fact that there were significant incentives in place 2 years ago. And IMO the price competition from cars like the Sonata and now the Optima are the main reason why Honda has to offer big incentives to move cars that the automotive press routinely proclaims as ""best in class.""

I think the PP & BE board has been a really terrific addition to our Forums. I guess it's been up and running for a number of years now and I know it's been a great help to many, many members - myself included.But I do think it's important for those of us who rely on the exact numbers being posted to be aware that you can't always know the total deal. Something I wish folks would question more closely when people post what look like great deals is the trade-in details, i.e., was there a trade-in, what vehicle was it, in what (fairly assessed) condition and what allowance did you get for it?The reason I say that is because it's not the least bit unusual for a dealership to undervalue the trade-in for the specific purpose of lowering the stated purchase price.Another thing to wonder about is the total amount of ""document fees"" - some dealerships will ink a deal that looks great when you're looking at what they say they are selling you the car for, but then when you go to drive away, you find that there are additional fees up one side and down the other.I don't want to turn this into a debate over the posts on that board, but I do want to caution that there may be more than meets the eye to some of these deals that seem so deeply discounted - no MATTER what car we're talking about.

Note that Edmunds says those maintenance costs include both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. I doubt the number of oil changes is going account for a difference of this magnitude over 5 years. Unless Camry requires an oil change every month or something. I don't buy the unsupported speculation that Toyota is more ""honest"". Warranty Direct, in their defintion of terms, happens to mention that: Toyota, for example, has a high average cost of repair but quite a good index rating - which means that the car fails infrequently but when it does you will be in for a larger than average bill.

I guess these statistics, which tell us that an 8 yr old Honda will report an average of 55 problems/100 vehicles as opposed to 110 for a Ford, mean nothing? Magically I guess the American consumer is supposed to line up to buy a Fusion based on 18 months of some decent reliability conveniently ignoring past histories, when the Accord has been that way for 20 years or so? Or maybe we should really believe those ridiculous TV commercials?to quote the article and survey:""American manufacturers still have not closed the gap between them and the Asians. Ford has been, and continues to be the most reliable among the domestic manufacturers for older vehicles"" "

There are problems with looking at things simply in terms of the number of generic ""problems per 100 vehicles"". Just one is that the assumption that 55 vs. 110 really means much of any significance.There are other problems with CR red circle data and their data collection methods. There are problems with assuming that because manufacturer X has a better stat than mfr Y, this means every model from X is better than every model from mfr Y. "

They are paying more for the Accord because the media has beat it into thier heads that it is worth it when it is not. Wow scape2, how many times have you said this? (100 or more). Talk about beating something into people's heads. When I bought my first Accord in 91, I had no subscription to any car magazine, and had not read any. I rode to work in a friend's 81 Accord (130 miles round trip). The car had little power, but I could tell the car had very solid construction, and I was very surprised by how well the suspension worked, for such a light car. He was always telling me how great the car was. I decided to try the 92 Accord. I drove that car for 12 years, and 140k miles. I learned in that time why so many people have ""I love my Honda"" stickers and lisence plate frames on their cars. When I decided to buy a new car, it was going to be an Accord, and the ""MEDIA"" had absolutely nothing to do with it. The ACCORD, had everything to do with it. The ""media"" did not make the Accord a great car. Honda did. "

What this forum needs is some sarcasm :P What I am reading here is that people think there is some sort of conspiracy behind the public perception that Accord and Camry are of the highest quality... as if Accords and Camrys really aren't made better and worth more than the average car? That people just think that way because that is what ""the media"" tells them?Why does ""the media"" portray them as being of the highest quality? What motive would ""the media"" have to do so if they didn't think it was true? What reasons could they have had to ever start praising them after they were introduced and further improved through the years?Is it a conspiracy? Or could it be that all of the independent media outlets, and the buying public, have mostly arrived at the same conclusions for a reason? Where did the ""perception"" begin, and why?Could it have been the journalists? Did the majority of independent media outlets all come together and agree to get their stories straight, to falsely represent Honda and Toyota? Why? For what purpose?Could it be Honda and Toyota? Do they convince the public that their cars are better soley through advertising, marketing, PR, etc? Doubtful, every manufacturer tries to do that.The public themselves? For years, Honda and Toyota drivers have habitually lied to their friends, family and co-workers, and on surveys such as JD Power, about how great their cars are? And drivers of other makes have been lying as well, making up stories of how mediocre or bad their cars are? Or is it just that Honda and Toyota have had a better record for many years?Regardless, the perception isn't going away anytime soon. I think Accord and Camry earned it. They now have some tough competition, and while that says alot for the competitors it doesn't take anything away from Accord or Camry. Plus, I don't buy any of these ""initial quality"" reports. That is the thing about long-term reliability and future resale values... only time will tell if they've lost their edge. "

Here is an example from May 2005I believe that this is the point people were trying to make. The date on the example you provide is from May 05, which puts it into the end of model year category.

 I used that date because I was replying to a question about pricing from two years ago. I didn't realize May is considered ""end of model year"", but maybe that is how Honda considers it. I always thought of ""end of model year"" being in the fall, through the end of the year.So I guess those who want a deal on an Accord had better move fast... since Honda apparently doesn't care about what Sonatas, Optimas etc. are priced at, only Camrys and Altimas, and those have few incentives now, when the new Accords arrive the incentives will go ""poof!"".

I'm all for more competition in this segment as the differences narrow... it only helps the consumer.Personally, any kind of advertising doesn't hold a candle to my own experiences with a vehicle. And to be perfectly clear, if Accords and Camrys were perfect, there would hardly be any Fusions, Sonatas, etc. sold at all. :shades: "

There were a lot of things that led up to a '93 Accord purchase. In the 90s, before Honda peaked, they made tight, fun to drive cars. I liked the visibility, I liked the low hood line, and the manual transmission was the cream of the crop of FWD in the early 90s (although the clutch sucked from day 1). The media acentuated all of these items. The reliablity of the car has been fine, although not as stellar as others experience. It was basically easy to work on (with the exception of front brakes), and returned good fuel economy. The current Accord I just find totally unexciting. As I reflect on it, as a strategy, it makes a lot of sense. Build a car that 20/30 somethings want...redesign it a few years later for what 40 somethings want...redesign it a few years later for what 50 somethings want, etc.My issue is that I am not in the demographic for it anymore; I must be too young. I don't see myself replacing the Accord with another Accord. Its okay I don't see them hurting for buyers.  "

I think that the driving dynamics in the Accord aren't that much different than they used to be, except my new car has much better grip/roadholding. My new Accord also has an advanced engine (i-VTEC) with zingy top-end power and a great exhaust note. The interior is also beautifully designed (controls seem to have design flair on top of just having ergonomic excellence). My old car (1996) has a very VERY bland interior, a basic SOHC engine, a back seat that makes six-footers cringe, and a design that is classy if not necessarily sporty.I don't necessarily think Honda is a whole-lot different, but I think it has changed for the better in the places where it is (back seat, interior design, engine technology/economy/power).

I am in no way a mechanic, and I changed the brake pads myself (once), with the help of the service manual. No problem. Its cool you were wrenching on your ride. Changing disc pads is a good start, its usually pulling the wheels and then 1 or 2 bolts to get the pads out of the calipers.The issue comes with pulling the rotors to be turned, or replacing the rotors. The rotor is effectively pressed onto the hub, requiring a considerable amount of disassembly to replace.My guess is you didn't replace or turn the rotors as specified in the manual (its not a super big deal, I have done that in the past as well with other vehicles- it just leads to accelerated pad wear and increases the likelihood of chatter, squeal, and uneven braking) "

OK, even if the ""Fusion Challenge"" didn't have all of the cards stacked in the Fusions favor by the track layout or the wording of the survey questions, etc... People weren't actually buying Fusions there, were they?There is a big difference between a consumer (who may or may not be an actual buyer or even in the market in the first place) SAYING on a survey that they prefer one vehicle over another, and actually going out and having to choose one to PURCHASE.It sounds to me like the Fusion Challenge mainly focused on styling and handling (""See how much better the AWD Fusion drives around this autocross track than its FWD competitors!""). Did the survey include questions about which cars the consumers thought had the best quality/long-term reliability, or which cars would retain the most value? If handling had been the most important factor in my decision to purchase, and other factors such as reliability record, resale value, and drivetrain were not important to me at all, then I would probably have agreed with the Fusion Challenge.AGAIN to each his own! That test proves nothing about the Fusion being better overall than Accord. It just proves that, to some consumers, it excels in a couple of different areas. "

I've enjoyed the banter between several of you on the Accord, Fusion, Camry. I had a 2007 Camry and it was the V-6 XLE. The 4 cylinder is a toally different car, and much less expensive. The Camry V-6 is a rcoket compared to anything in the other models. It also has a beautiful, Lexus like interior. Perhaps best of all it takes regular fuel and gets strong mileage numbers. My only problem with it was it didn't handle well, and I felt like a fuddy duddy in it. So on to the Nissan Altima and another V-6 with 270 h.p. with the SE package and far superior handling. Consumers Reports ranks it right there with the Honda and Volkswagon Passat for top honors. The 4 cylinder is very quick and also gets a strong write-up. Funny the Fusion finishes well down the list and once again Ford puts no ponies and mediocre mileage in an inferior engine. It does handle very well. I'd tell anyone to look at either the 4 or 6 in an Altima and you'll get great exceleration, good mileage, great handling, push button start and a transmission in CVT form that is extraodinary. Just weighing in on behalf of the Nissan fans. "

We get Fusion 4 cyl rentals to go from LAX up the coast to my folks place pretty regularly. I have always found them to be pretty thrifty on fuel and they seem to feel bigger on the inside then they look on the outside (which is kind of the opposite of my old Contour). It's easy to drive and has good visibility. The next trip home we will have a lot more baggage with us so we will see how the trunk does then, so far it hasn't been an issue.I am really leaning towards the Mazda6 right now. I made the mistake of driving a Speed6 last night, which I think is the most fun I've had in quite some time. I can't swing a new one, but it looks like Mazda 6s GTs are a pretty good deal used and reasonably easy to find in a manual transmission. "

You really should grab a Fusion or Milan rental and check it out. Hertz for one has a lot of them. I thought the base Fusion (stick, no options) I drove was a very nice car even in stripped form, with a great blend of ride and handling. The stick was pretty good too. Now that the IIHS crash test scores are improved, I think the Fusion and Milan are solid offerings in this class. I haven't quite warmed up to the Gillette grille on the Fusion, so I prefer the Milan styling-wise (also because the Milan comes very well equipped even in base form, with ABS standard). "

When any of the actual current CARS are compared (styling; build quality; handling; ride quality; comfort and convenience features;safety features;acceleration;fuel economy etc.) the Accord lovers on this forum have a very hard time defending their 'best in class' arguements. So they inevitably abandon discussion of current CARS and instead revert to discussion of how the market place rated reliability and /or resale in previous years ( where the Accord does have an excellent track record).It`s hard for any competitor to come to the table with out giving it time to devlop it`s own record !

As I remember - the warranty paid to repair a blown air conditioner twice, to fix the front brakes, and to replace both front head light assemblies(kept filling with water).

I went through 4 sets of tires before I traded it off.

My guess is you didn't replace or turn the rotors as specified in the manual (its not a super big deal, I have done that in the past as well with other vehicles- it just leads to accelerated pad wear and increases the likelihood of chatter, squeal, and uneven braking) I decided getting the rotors turned was unnecessary. I have never had to replace rotors on any car or truck. No problems with wear, chatter, squeal, or uneven braking either. Even if the pads wore a little faster (which I doubt since I only changed them once in 140k miles) I think I could have changed them twice as often, doing it myself, for less than paying someone else to change them, and turn the rotors making them thinner, and weaker.

Finally, something worth responding to.Rotors only need to be turned if they're out of spec on runout. A few hard stops will normally clear any surface glaze or rust on the rotor or pads.

When new pads go on grooved rotors, they wear ""funny"" and that creates the griding and squealing. The more aggressive the pad, the more friction, the better the braking performance. Certain OEMs that have softer pads to protect the rotors are also criticized for having brakes that are considered not as strong as those of competitors (and excessive brake dust).I personally have had good luck with Axxis metal-master pads (or Hawks for the track events), and Brembo blanks (about the same as the OEM rotor from the dealer).

To me paying $150-200 per axle for brake pads and turning rotors, to be sure the brakes will be as good as they can be is cheap insurance.

This is a great thread.IMHO; it's not how hard or soft the pads are that cause the groves. It's not the groves that cause squealing or chattering when the pads come in contact with the rotors. Disk brake manufacturers have a spec for the depth of a grove that requires turning as well as a spec for the thickness of the rotors. The brake shop will know what the specs are. A good shop wont do the job if you don't want to turn rotors that the manufactures says need it. If you do the job yourself, like I usually do you have know the specs before you start. In my nearly 50 years of experience, which goes back before disk brakes were used on US automobiles, I have developed the following guidelines (for myself only). If the groves are less than 0.002"" I leave them alone. If any are over o.oo2"" deep I turn the rotors.What causes the minor groves in the rotors is dirt, sand, and tinny metal par ticals picked up from the road. It doesn't make any difference what the pads are made of, they will all pick up this junk and scratch/grove your rotors.Replace your pads with a compound that best meets your driving style. Don't put on metallic pads designed for racing, just because you think it's cool. Don't use soft OEM pads if you do a lot of ""performance"" driving on mountain roads. Metallics take time to heat up to a useful temperature and soft pads fade after a few hard stops. "

It's not the groves that cause squealing or chattering when the pads come in contact with the rotors.That has been different then my experience, but I have also used some very aggressive brake pads. On a track environment, there is very little debris to pick up and get stuck in your pads. If you have a hard, aggressive pad and a soft rotor, the rotor is going to get eaten.If you do the job yourself, like I usually do you have know the specs before you start. Yeah, its been a very long time since anyone other than myself touched my brakes. I usually have to borrow the dial gauge to check for warping.Replace your pads with a compound that best meets your driving style.

Metallics take time to heat up to a useful temperature and soft pads fade after a few hard stops.This is an incredibly valid point. Hawks I would only use for racing (although they have a street pad, its pretty pricey), while the Axxis pads have a cool enough thermal range to work well on the street (which is their intended use).When I would do HDPE stuff, a lot of times guys would leave their racing pads on at the end of the day and drive back to the hotel. Then, first thing in the morning they would get up, jump in their car and head for the MickyD's drive thru, where they would then realize how poorly stone cold racing pads work as they rear-end the vehicle in front of them. :sick: "

The way I hear it, the shims and whatever that greasy stuff that goes between them are what keeps the brakes from chattering and squealing. I have never had any rotors turned, and so far (knock on wood) I haven't had a problem with brakes. I see many posts about warped rotors and pads wearing prematurely, and it makes me wonder if all these people live in the mountains, where riding the brakes down hill would be harder on pads and rotors than the flatlands in south Louisiana. I have heard how much of a pain it was to remove the rotors on 90's Accords (some have actually converted them to rotor over hub using old Acura CL parts). I must be easy on brakes cause I've never experienced this (knock on wood again).  "

My brother's '85 Accord went through pads and rotors like crazy. Every time the car needed pads he had to replace the rotors. Rotors were to thin to ""turn"". Maintenance on that Accord was quite expensive when anything broke down.

A broken radio antennae (a top of the right side A pillar) required tearing apart the dash board. Hmmmm...'85 Accord, look at what Honda had done since.

Or you get a promotion, and that new Corolla CE doesn't quite have the panache that you desire.I wouldn't be surprised that on average, a new car stays with the original owner for five years before being sold. So yes, resale value is often (although not always) important.In 2000, I bought a new Chrysler 300M (a great car BTW and still going strong at 120K miles) for 30K. Today it's worth around 5K. If I would have bought a 20K Accord, it would probably still be worth about 10K. Fortunately, I'm not in a situation where I have to sell the car. High resale value was one of the numerous reasons we bought an '06 Accord. We figured if our needs changed down the road, we wouldn't take a bath on the car if we sold it. "

The Fusion is a great looking car, and may be equal to the Accord in some areas. One area where the Accord seems to be ahead of the Fusion is when both are equipped with the base engine and a manual transmission. Here's what the Consumer Guide says:""With manual transmission, 4-cyl Fusions are adequate at best and feel slower than our test car's 9.2 sec 0-60 time would suggest. Inordinately heavy clutch action, balky shift linkage makes manual transmission unpleasant to use.""In contrast:""Four cyl Accords peppy enough with slick-shifting manual transmission; test EX coupe did 7.9 seconds 0-60 mph.""The Accord sedan weighs about 75 lbs more, but should still get from 0-60 in less than 8.5 seconds.So, the Accord's transmission seems to be smoother, and its engine is slightly larger and more powerful, and yet the EPA rates the 4-cyl Accord with manual at 26/34, while the Fusion is rated 23/31. For some models the Fusion may be close to equal, but for this base model it seems the Accord is substantially ahead. Of course, the Accord probably costs about $2000 more. But it appears that a good chunk of that money goes into a better engine and transmission. "

C&D seems to specialize in milking the best 0-60 times out of all cars, they must have 'car abuse king' testers that compete! Not to say that you personally might not be able to do the same thing, but I doubt seriously that 99% of us are going to be able to get the car to 60 in less than 8 seconds, and while the CG test is more conservative, perhaps might get closer to that 9+ time in the Fusion 4 banger.

""2007 Accord LX Sedan 5-speed manual, 0-60 in 7.5 seconds - that's pretty quick for a 4 banger"" That's the beauty of the current ""horsepower war"" - everything is faster, even the 4 bangers. My last sedan was a Mazda 626 with a V6 generating 170 HP and 165 TQ. It would go 0-60 in 7.2 seconds when equipped with a manual. The 4-banger in the Accord has become just as powerful and very nearly as fast as most V6s of 5-10 years ago, especially when you consider the new revised power ratings.Normally I'd agree with you about the C&D testing procedures and a car being faster in their hands than in the hands of the average driver, but I don't think that applies to the Accord. Here's why: the average car is considerably slower in the more conservative 5-60 test than in the all-out 0-60 run, but the difference is only 0.4 seconds for the Accord. The Accord's 5-60 time of 7.9 seconds is on par with cars that go faster 0-60. Additionally, most cars that match its 0-60 time of 7.5 seconds have a slower 5-60 time. Bottom line? Just as some cars feel slower than their specs on paper suggest, in my opinion the Accord drives faster than its spec sheet suggests. "

The main reason, IMO, that the Accord is such a nice car with manual is that it's the same exact car they sell in Japan.

the 'feeling' of quickness probably has something to do with torque and where that torque peaks. Torque may not influence acceleration times in the same way that HP does, but it sure does help with some drivability issues as well as that 'feeling' of quickness.Have a sneaking suspicion that some test driver for a C&D road test is revving the heck out of that Accord and then, popping the clutch in a trial/error process attempting to squeeze a few tenths here and there. My point was, that this is not likely something you would do to your own car and a degree of abuse that the vast majority of drivers never do - therefore, you 'real' 0-60 should be slower - as would it be for all cars.

The only variable there would be how much throttle to give (and resulting wheelspin if any). Accord is only 4 tenths slower to 60 in that test than the standard 0-60, whereas most other cars (like the Fusion) have a larger 0-60/5-60 difference.Car and Driver test results:Accord I4 5M0-60 mph 7.5 Street start, 5-60 mph 7.9Fusion I4 5M0-60 mph 8.1 Street start, 5-60 mph 9.0Difference:0-60 0.65-60 1.1See my point?

As far as that 1.1 seconds goes, I can feel it in something as insignificant as highway passing. I can feel it in off-the-line response. And, if the numbers aren't considerably faster, the way in which the car accelerates is much more effortless versus the Fusion in my perception. ""Considerably faster"" is subjective, my friend.I got the 4-cylinder. Acceleration wasn't tops on my list, but when I could get good the best fuel economy from a car that was also quicker than many (all at the time, actually)of its competing 4-cylinders, I knew I had found my car.I guess I'm not ""most"" though. Referencing post 480, the Aura has to be the best offering from GM in the midsize arena in a dozen years. GM should've imported Opels all-along, they have to be better than things like the late '90s Lumina.I'm glad to see GM finally having some products it can be proud of other than trucks. As I see it, Ford should be proud of its Fusion, but perfuming the pig on the Focus and Escape? Shame on you Ford. You succeeded with an all-new Fusion and it receives great reviews, can't you give us a new Escape and Focus in less than 8 years? Or will the Fusion be around, with nothing new but a fascia, in 8 years? I certainly hope not. The bar is moving way too fast for that. "

GM should've imported Opels all-alonggrad - they kinda have - remember the Cimarron that I think went off the market back in the late 80s, and there also is a lot of 'Opel' in the CTS as well. Agree about GM finally getting its act together though (and Ford's inability to keep up) - it will interesting to see if a 'good' Malibu can 'sell' without the now traditional GM discount structures as this would obviously be good for GM as well. Folks that go out and shop Camcords expect to negotitate from window sticker, those that shop the US brands expect something much more. It would seem that if the Aura is going to be sold the way they are ('no nonsense' pricing) that the consumer is going to expect the new Malibu with a good size discount, meaning that GM would have to artificially inflate the sticker to accomodate the discounts - like what they do with Buicks.

If you have to drive a lot of miles and pay $3.40/gal like we do in California, you should have a small econobox. So what's up with all this banter about 0-60, 5-60 etc?The cars are all about MPG, not acceleration.I don't drive a lot of miles and preferred acceleration and comfort so I opted for the Aura XR.

Considering how far a vehicle travels at 60mph in one second, I think it would be noticeable. On the other hand the sound of the engine, the way the transmission shifts, and suspension can make a car feel faster than it really is. This was commented on by a reviewer in the 03 ""Midsize Sedan Comparison"" test. The reviewer commented that because the 03 Altima engine was louder, and suspension stiffer, it felt like it was faster than the 03 Accord, when in reality it wasn't. "

So if you drove around in a Mustang V6 for a while, and then switched to a Mustang GT, you really don't think you would notice much difference? Pulling out into traffic? Merging onto the highway?

I don't, and wasn't, disagreeing with anything you said. Fact is I agree with you comments about how significant a second is in 0-60 times. Anyone that has been street racing or just doing the stoplight grand prix, will KNOW THE DIFFERENCE of a few tenths, especially if they come in second place time after time.I hate to be second, it's just another word for looser.I used to drive a car with a 2.5L turbo and 5 speed. It was a few tenths quicker than the Mustang 5.0 to 60 and in the 1/4. It got the same MPG as the Mustang too, which proves it takes X amount of Gasoline to make Y amount of power and propel Z weight to V velocity in a specified T time.Physics? "

My point wasn't that you wouldn't feel a difference, but rather that your ""feelings"" would not be able to tell whether that difference was one or the other if the time difference was less than a second going 0-60 or thereabouts. Both would show acceleration, and give a feeling thereof. If the ONLY difference was less than 1 second of time, or less than that, do you think you would know which one was faster.

I too think I got performance and economy. I guess those two terms are relative. I think for a performance car it should be able to do ov er 95 in a 1/4 mile, do it in under 15 seconds. 0-60 should be as close to 6 seconds as you can get, quicker if you can afford it. Top speed isn't real important because I hardly ever want to go over 100 anyway.On the economy side I like 30 MPG but had to give up 2 for the performance I wanted. So, for about $26K I get 0-60 in 5.9, 1/4 mile in 14.7 @97MPH and fantastic ride, handling and comfort. But I only get 28MPG highway and 22 in the city.Relatively speaking, good enough for me. "

I'll be perfectly honest, I just can't shift that fast nor do I abuse my cars like they do to get those times. However, I can say that jd10013 makes a good point. There are times that I look down at the speedo of the Mustang, after taking off from a stop hard and fast on my way home from work, and see that I'm doing 80 or 90 MPH. I'm still used to seeing 60 MPH at those same points in the road which is how fast I'd have been going in the 6 at that point. I then realize how much faster the Mustang is but up until I look down it just feels like I'm going really fast regardless of which car I was in. So the feeling is the same in a hard launch IMO. You fell like you're going really fast. How fast you are really going isn't realized until you look at the gauges. That's when the ""I'm going to pee my pants"" feeling kicks in.  "

I would not call it an ""advanced timing maneuver"", whatever car you are driving the best way to pass is to do most of the accelerating before going into the oncoming lane. Instead most people will tailgate the car in fromt of them, then when they see an opening they swing out into the oncoming lane and then accelerate to pass. Even at 40 mph, the proper minimum following distance is 120 feet, based on the 2 sec rule. I'd guess that space should be enough to do most of the acceleration needed for passing, even with ""only"" 150 HP or so in a 3000 pound car. I just can't see ever cutting a passing maneuver so close that 0.5 to 1 sec would make a difference. It's fine that you want a V6, I just don't buy your attempts at rationalizing it as almost a need.

In some situations. But its hard to make an apples to apples comparison being as nissan no longer makes auto transmission. The only way to know for sure would be to test an auto altima (which doesn't exist) against a cvt altima. the same way the sticks are compared to autos. but even nissan themselves rate the cvt version as having 1 mpg wors than the stick version. But, the cvt does get better mpg than most any automatic out there, under most driving conditions. It' the most fuel efficent auto out there, and very close to a stick. and I believe the comparisson was done with a sentra, that doesn't have the same version in it, and is not as good.But thats not the bennifit of the cvt, not to me at least. It't the way it handles, the acceleration you get at any speed, the overall smoothness of it. and after having drove about 2k miles with it now, i stand by my prediction. In 10 years most cars will have the option of a standard or cvt. the automatic transmission will go the way of the carburator. "

I wouldn't consider a v6 a need either, but it is fun. I think it just a matter of how far engines and cars have come.

jd10013 ","
I don't think you can get a versa with an automatic either. I believe nissan has switched all their cars to either cvt or stick. this is from a review, can't remember where:""A CVT has no forward gears or complex clutches and bands. Instead, there are two tapered pulleys with a steel belt connecting them. These pulleys can change their effective diameter through a signal from the computer. If the pulley halves are squeezed together making them narrower, the diameter in effect, increases causing the belt to move to the outer edge. At the same time, the other pulley would spread out causing the diameter to decrease. Changes in the two pulleys are always coordinated to keep the belt taut.If the smaller pulley is being turned by the engine (the drive pulley), the steal belt would turn the larger pulley (the driven pulley) more slowly. If the diameters change, the speed of the driven pulley will also change. By allowing the computer to control the diameters of the two pulleys, the transmission ratio will smoothly and gradually change from low ""gear"" to high ""gear"" This design eliminates the need for a 4 speed, five speed or even a six speed transmission, instead allowing for an infinite number of ""speeds"". The net effect is better fuel economy (at light throttle, the engine rpm is always at the optimal point for maximum fuel efficiency), and better performance (the engine can stay in its sweet spot for maximum horsepower delivery)"" "

In fact you can't get a base Versa with the CVT in the U.S., just the 4-speed automatic or 6-speed stick.Which leads to a thought... since the Versa is roomier than some ""mid-sized"" cars, especially in back, is it a mid-sized car? I'll bet most people don't consider it mid-sized, but it can hold four adults in comfort with the best of the mid-sized field. There's a few other small cars like that too, e.g. Elantra and Sentra. I wonder if people who are satisfied with a four-cylinder cross-shop cars like that when looking for a ""mid-sized"" car? FWIW, I do. "

Yes, the Versa (95 cubic feet) has less interior volume than the Sentra (97) or Altima (101), but the Versa is actually considered a mid-sized car by the EPA, as are the Sentra and Elantra (98). The Mazda6 is considered a mid-sized car, but has only 96 cubic feet, just one more than the Versa and less than the Sentra and Elantra. The Accord EX has only 98 cubic feet according to Honda. The Legacy has only 93 cubic feet! So these smaller cars match up pretty well in interior room against some of the mid-sized cars.

So we can baseline that 9s+ 0-60 and convince ourselves that that must be good because that is what the Accord V6 was able to do 10 years ago, or we can enjoy the added safety of that extra power, and know that that efficiency is not effectively costing much at the gas pumps.

Well, after months of ownership and being overall very pleased with the Accord, I have my first complaint. The manual locking mechanisms for each individual door are the pull style, and are located on top of the window sill by the B-pillar. This is right in the way of where I sometimes like to rest my arm/elbow, especially when the windows are down. On my old car, the mechanism was a lever that was built into the side of the door right by the door handle. My solution? I unscrewed the pull itself, and removed it, leaving a small hole where it used to stick up. I'll probably try to find some sort of cap to pop in there.

Back in 96 the V6 Accord was pretty much a wasted effort. It only added 25hp, over the 4cyl VTEC engine, and added (like the captain said) almost 200 lbs because it had a cast iron block, which made it close to a wash, as far as power to weight ratio. The V6 in the current Accord adds about 80 hp, which is more than enough to account for the added weight. The 4cyl has gained 25hp since 96, and the V6 has gained 75hp since then.

Well, maybe they didn't want to follow in Ford's footsteps of renaming its cars every decade. As a former ford customer (many, many years ago) I think I know why they do that. I think, its because they allow their cars to become so inferior in quality, style, and reliability that they have too. I, for example, owned two Ford escort. both ran fine till about 70k miles, then were nothing but problems. everything from major engine problems to buttons and knobs breaking, to the most bizzare of all, the catch for the door lock (the metal piece on the frame) actualy rusted (actualy it was the body that rusted) and fell off. I couldn't close the door.But getting back to the point, If ford had kept making them and ever improved the car, it woundn't have mattered. it wouldn't have mattered how many awards that car would have won, or how great the reviews would have been; i would never have bought one again in my life. IMHO, ford (and to some extent GM) have such a reputation for letting their cars go to crap that they have to ditch them and start over. "

when my wife and I traded in our '01 Kia Sportage 4X4 in on a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS. It's funny because I was a staunch supporter of manual tranny's and defended their continued usage in light of the CVT's and paddle-shifters becoming prevalent in newer cars.We test drove a Lancer GTS with CVT and really liked it. It is a smooth manner of transmitting the power to the wheels and the acceleration is smooth and steady. There isn't the lurching that is present in standard automatics as the transmission searches for correct gearing.I noticed last night coming home from the store that deceleration is fast with this tranny...no sooner had I let up on the accelerator I was quietly drifting to a stop outside our driveway. Fuel economy has been around 19mpg city and 31 mpg highway, certainly fair enough for us. We've been driving Kia's the past 8 years, which are heavy vehicles that don't really get maximum gas mileage but are good, steady vehicles that rarely presented us with any problems.Since the dealership had my color(Rally Red)and the Lancer GTS had the Sun and Sound package(Rockford Fosgate 650-watt 9-speaker stereo system with subwoofer in the trunk and sunroof)already installed I forgot all about needing a 5-speed manual tranny. My wife(who doesn't drive)offered that she would be comfortable driving this car and my son drives but not stick so the car would work for our family as a whole and I buried my 5-speed desires for this car. I may return some day to sticks but the way it's going they may be on their way out. I am one who hopes they stay around.The '08 Lancer GTS has aluminum paddle shifters so I can still play if I want. They work great and you can rev up the rpm's as much has you want and then just ""flip"" the paddle in the + direction and the small 4-door sedan responds appropriately. I like the idea and this car and it's transmission are a good fit for us. The Lancer GTS is built tight and there are no shakes, rattles or pops anywhere. I read that people have been unhappy with Mitsubishi's interiors for a while but this one is neat and clean and functionality is smartly appointed in the cabin. Mitsubishi is determined to come back and this new Lancer GTS is a great effort by them in that regard. "

the only reason nissan has the best cvt out there is just because they invested more time an money into it than anyone else. same way toyota has the best hybrids on the market, they just worked harder on them. I think most every car company out there has used it on at least one model. Honda had a civic with one, ford used it some in the fiesta. the problme the cvt's had was (as you said) dealing with the greater HP and torque in larger engines. Nissan decided to put more R&D money into solving that than other companies did. And as for the future of 270 hp 4 banger, I think your right. In 15 years I doubt many cars will even have combustion engines in them. Once Lithium Ion batteries are perfected, the combustion engine in a car will only be for recharging the battery. "

""I guess we'll see how the market accepts them, it does kinda redefine the driving experience - would imagine that some folks won't like it.""It's the VERY reason I bought mine--traded in an '04 VW NB TDI 5 Spd. Had always preferred a manual, but loved the smoothness in conjunction with the performance of the 3.5 V-6. We've gone from two-, three-, four-, five- and even six-speed automatics--STOP! How does one ever get into high gear in everyday stop-and-go driving? Also, the CVT reminds me of the old Buick Dynaflow transmissions of 1948-1963, except without the slip--and especially the ones from 1955-1963 with the switch-pitch variable torque converter. That same device was applied to the 1965-1967 Turbo-Hydramatics in Buicks, Oldses and Cadillacs. When I press the Altima's accelerator past a certain point, it has the jump associated with the Variable Pitch Turbo-Hydramatics. "

the smoothness factors you mention are some of the reasons that folks will like it. The sensation of driving the thing is, however, almost like driving backwards, depending on how hard and fast you step on the accelerator the engine will set to a speed, and then, the car seems to 'catch up' as the gears slide seamlessy under you. No more of the rev up to shift point, rev up to shift point etc. etc. - it is different. "

I still can't get the MazdaSpeed6 out of my head. That was the most fun I've had in a long time. Its biggest drawback is the 93 octane fuel requirement; I'm sure they could make it run on 91, but it wouldn't be as fun.I also took the MazdaSpeed6 for a ride a couple weeks ago and compared to my v-6 Mazda6, it's quite a bit faster and more balanced b/c of AWD. I had a chance to drive the car along a curvy route that I often take w/ my 6, and the MS6 had much less understeer and accelerated out of corners much better. Seems that the MS6's torque comes in much quicker and it has quite a bit more pull. Also, I think the MS6 comes with stickier rubber, so grip was much better. What a blast! I was actually wondering if I was scaring the salesguy on my test drive... :P I think most of the gas around here is 91, so if that's a step down in power for the MS6, it's still quite good. I was very tempted to do a deal, but then since I bought my car a little more than a year ago, I didn't think it would be very responsible. And when it came down to it, I still love how my car handles when I want to push it a bit. Plus the stopping power in a normal Mazda6 is amazing... I think I remember hearing 60-0 in 120 feet. With the typical inattentive driver out there, this has come in handy a couple times already  But I was very impressed with the mazdaspeed. Even in the dry, like my testdrive was in, the AWD managed power much better than just a front wheel drive car. Granted, my 6 only has 215 HP, but even that can get a bit too much for a fwd car at times. Add in the many days of wet weather we get in the NW, AWD would be that much more valueable. "

cars have certainly gotten better from a durability perspective over the years (as well as more expensive) and it wasn't all that long ago that a car with 50 or 60k on it was deemed 'worn out'.The question I pose for all to comment on is what do we really expect these days to be reasonable repair costs outside of maintainence items such as tires, brakes, batteries, fluid changes, belts/hoses, possibly CV joints etc. My vote will go for 150k with no reliability related failures over a time period of 6-7 years or so. This would be how I personally define a 'good' car. To me, these long term drivetrain or extended warranties mean little because as a rule I haven't had anything of real consequence go wrong within those time/mileage frames for the last several cars I've purchased new - most of them Altimas.

torque steer and FWD cars is an interesting problem- remember that my old 92 Maxima at 190hp was a handful at times even more so than my wife's 240hp 03 Altima. My personal driver, an Avalon, has no discernable torque steer I think largely eliminated thru transmission and DBW throttle programming (the new TL-S does it this way as well) by simply delaying gear and throttle engagements - but it can be annoying. Other approaches that I've heard working is lowering the engine in such a way that the halfshaft angles to the wheel centerlines are almost flat. But, in any case, none of this 'solves' weight distribution and understeer issues. Overall, however, for those folks that do have to spend some time on snowy roads, I still believe that FWD is the setup of choice. "

I think that counts as innovation, and they kind of pioneered the modular platform concept in mass production (K-cars and minivans on same platform).Saturn had very innovative body panels, and engines that were designed for the application proved to be robust if not smooth.Thats a few decades of innovation. I think people see what they want to see. "

The question I pose for all to comment on is what do we really expect these days to be reasonable repair costs outside of maintainence items such as tires, brakes, batteries, fluid changes, belts/hoses, possibly CV joints etc. My vote will go for 150k with no reliability related failures over a time period of 6-7 years or so.I would agree on the time. I would like 6-7 years of minimal problems. We would not get that many miles in so short a time, though. We would only have 50-70K in that time. I can not expect 150K miles beacause that would be 15-20 years. I keep track of maintenance and repair costs. On older cars, most of the time I see $400-800 per year for this. This seems okay to me. When it gets up over $1000 in a year is when I start feeling like the car is having too many problems. "

Where'd you get that? He said ""it was becoming an expensive hobby."" It is undoubtedly cheaper to buy new Hondas every two years than new domestic vehicles, based on resale values, but it doesn't mean it is without cost.

My father drives cars for about 60,000 miles, and by then, he's ready for something new and different. Last time his 2-year old Accord got rear ended though, he bought another JUST like it. Same color. Same powertrain. Same trim-level. I was amazed. He put 69,000 miles on it then couldn't take it anymore and got the car that had his eye since it came out. An Atomic Blue Civic EX Sedan.

I would argue they would be better off putting that type of two-tiered cluster in the Accord, since the typical buyer is usually older than a Civic buyer, and it offers real usability advantages for older drivers. Go find one of those early 90s Buicks that still have the big rectangular speedometers and measure the character height, and then check that against the speedo in the double-deck Civic. There are other advantages too but thats a start. "

HUH??? Are you saying you trade a 2 year old Toyota/Honda in for a new one? The dealer makes no profit?No - I said I keep each about 4 years, but do it every 2 years. Traded my wife's Camry in on an Odyssey. They gave us what we owed on the car as a trade-in value (was a 5 year loan initially and we put nothing down) and we paid what Edmunds said was the going price for the van.I did the same with an Accord. They gave me what my payoff was for the car (again - had a 5 year loan, no money down initially) and I paid (again) what Edmunds said was the going price of an Acura TL.Both times these cars were legitimately worth what the payoff was on them (or more) which made them both real easy to get out of and into the next vehicle. The dealer wanted my trades. Not many other makes can you get out of them for the payoff in the early years of ownership.This scenario NEVER happened when I traded in the Fords we owned. Especially the Taurus. The dealer didn't want my trade. "

That's because the Taurus had huge incentives and huge rental fleet presence which killed resale values.Estimate resale on the Fusion is just under the Accord and just above the Camry. Why? Because they aren't putting huge amounts of cash on the hood and they're not dumping them into rental fleets and the quality is just as good as the competition (or better - so far). If you make regular payments for 4 years on a 5 yr loan with nothing down and you don't have any equity - something's wrong. You'd be better off leasing if you know you want a new car every 4 years and you aren't paying them off early. "

I still have (and are running fine) all but the first nissan i bought in 1992. And I only got rid of that because it was starting to nickel and dime me to death. Engine/trans/body were fine. To me, that's the only downside to the longevity of japanese cars. When up around 12+ years/200k+ miles, because so many parts are still original, a LOT of things start to wear out at the same time.

Why does it bother you that someone chose a Honda, when you pride yourself on driving something different?The Fusion is likely the best-kept secret that the American companies have. It is certainly better than 80% of the competition. It just didn't offer what I wanted. WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND? WHY, IF I CHOSE HONDA, MUST I BE ACCUSED OF HATING FORD?Since we're giving praise reports, I'll have had my car 18 months next week, with 18,600 miles on it. I get close to 40 MPG on most trips, an average right at 30 MPG on my commute into Birmingham. My friends always want to take my car because it is so good on gas and a nice ride, while I know how much fun it really is to drive on the twisties when I push the car harder. I got the car for $21,200, which is $2,600 under sticker. The Fusion's TMV, equipped with the options of my Accord (but without a design that I found desirable) was $19,623. That's a difference of $1,587. For that $1,587, I got best-in-class resale value, a torquier engine, an interior that I desired more, better fuel economy, and a dealership DOWN THE STREET (something that is just dumb luck and really didn't matter at buy-time).

It's not the metal trim that makes me really like this interior, it is the design. If the quality of the plastics is solid, and the tactile quality of the switchgear is close to my Honda's (which I found to be the best, others may not), I'd say it is a real contender in the interior department! Compared to the boxy, blocky Fusion, the Mondeo looks like the model the Fusion should have been, in my eyes.

Not specifically to your post, but where does the electric energy come from? We hear all the talk about clean electricity. How is the electricity produced; buring coal, oil, natural gas or Heaven forbid :P nuclear?What is the energy effiency? Years ago, a friend of mine (38 years older than me) who is a retired plumber advised us to replace our worn out gas clothes dryer with a new gas clothes dryer (even though gas dryers are more expensive then electric dryers) because the gas transmission line is more effecient than electric lines (with their power loss through the electric lines). We've followed his advice for two replacement dryers.I don't pretend to know about all that stuff, but it seems logical to me. A direct pipeline to our dryer vs ""some"" energy source to an electric generator and then transmitted via power lines (with a loss of energy along the way) to reach an electric dryer. Unless the electricity produced is greater than the energy required to produce it and/or unless the machine consuming the energy consumes electricity more efficiently than an alternate direct fuel source, then bateries will be more expensive to operate (never mind replacing them at some point).

We're in an age of information and I choose to take advantage of it rather than use a narrow view of personal experience and second hand stories.

I wanted something fun to drive, had good hauling capabilities, something that I liked to look at, was a good value in up front costs, and was safe to drive. The people I've known that owned Mazda cars have had good experiences with them and more importantly had a passion for them that most other car owners have not had.

I know the main fuel comsumption would be to heat it, but today aren't there ways to heat water efficiently? At least with much less fuel than would be burned by even a small gasoline engine. Of course, the safety issue would have to be addressed, but again with today's materials, I don't see why that couldn't work in conjunction with a nice pop-off valve. I expect there'd have to be a way to get a quick head of steam on a 15 degree day, too. The things have massive torque from dead stop and wouldn't require a transmission. I'm sure it's been discarded for very good reasons, 'tho. It never did exist again after the 20s.

What is the energy effiency?Even coal can be pretty clean (leaving aside the carbon dioxide issue, nuclear solves that one :surprise: ). The reason being, it is a lot more cost effective to control emissions from one gigantic source rather than millions of tiny ones.It seems crazy that burning coal to boil water, to run steam turbines, to generate electricity, that is than sent through miles and miles of wires can be more efficient than an internal combustion engine, but I believe Tesla motors has some papers that show that this is the case. Some time time ago I did a calculation myself...looked at the equivalent mpg based on what the electricty would cost and the price of gasoline. At the time, I came up with their electric car being equivalent to getting about 100-300 mpg. Of course, this answer depends on what you pay for electricty and gasoline and whether you remove the taxes from the price of the gasoline. "

You mention roominess.

Just something to think about, I didn't realize that until I had almost made my mind up. "

I thin the big one is the insurance/fuel cost. Turbos don't require a whole lot extra at this point. I would be surprised if the car didn't call for synthetic oil, but that is about the only turbo related expense likely in my ownership.was the lack of a folding rear seatYeah, that was an issue for me too until the sales guy showed me that it does still have a folding seat. There is a trim piece that can me removed to provide access to the seat folding mechanism from the regular Mazda6. The cross-brace is still there but I am pretty sure what I need will fit around it.I think the bikes will be on the roof, so I am not worried about that, and the other car is the family truckster, so this one need not have the same level of utility.

Don't see much information about the Speed6.I guess I could see that with respect to the drivetrain, instead of 2 axles to need boots there are 4 to tear and rip and wear out, it has 18"" wheels so tires will be pricey, etc. The motor itself I am not too worried about, the 2.3 has been well proven, and I don't see myself cranking the boost or doing a lot of modifications to the car.Mazda has been doing Turbos for a long time, as has Mitsubishi (the Eclipse/Talon/Laser/Galant/Lancer turbos did well)and Subaru. Now even Acura and BMW are doing it on gasoline engines. I am not too worried about that part. "

And knowing that most car manufacturer's quality is now very good according to multiple sources (jd powers and cr), I felt comfortable choosing based on other priorities. I wanted something fun to drive, had good hauling capabilities, something that I liked to look at, was a good value in up front costs, and was safe to drive. I agree 100% with that. I think anyone who is buying one of the vehicles on this thread based solely on quality or reliability ratings is crazy. That's right, crazy. :P I understand some manufacturers had issues in the past with quality and reliability but times have changed and they changed fast. Any of these sedans are worthy of one's hard earned dollars and I don't feel any of them will let anyone down. If I were in the market for one I'd have no problem buying the one I liked best based on style and a good old fashioned road test and I feel anyone who's not tied a need for high resale (That does still vary and probably will for a little while longer), high fuel mileage, or low cost should do the same. There are fairly obvious choices to suit those needs in this comparison and I understand that people like that do exist. But we, as enthusiasts, need to be a little more open, right?  "

I think everyone buys a vehicle based on performance...the issue is different people define performance differently. Some feel the two bold numbers on the window sticker are the best measure of performance (MPG) others like red dots in a consumer publication, and still others like a bunch of stars next to various types of impacts. Still others like the number of horses under the hood, the feeling on a curve, or amount of headroom under the roof. I know there are other factors too but I am running out of prose.I think in reality it is a balance of these things. That balance is different for each individual. "

I think previous experience with a brand or model, are large factors when anyone buys their next car. If you are completely satisfied with your current car, you are likely to go back to it in the future. So the cars with the most satisfied customers, are logically the cars with the most repeat buyers. Of course, if your needs or wants change (family grows etc.), so can the choice.Some people are influenced by trends (SUV craze). Others do not care what ""everyone else"" is driving. I've never needed an SUV, so I've never owned one. I've always seen SUVs as wagons that ride like trucks (not what I want). "

Of course, this answer depends on what you pay for electricity and gasoline and whether you remove the taxes from the price of the gasoline. LOLTaxes is probably the stopper. Here in CT the state doesn't wack us hard enough with a $0.45 tax per gallon so they also have a gross earnings tax applied at the wholesale level. It's currently 6.3% and increasing to 7% on July 1. The gas station I normally go to is currently charging $3.159 per gallon. If the station is making $0.15 per gallon, the wholesale price is $2.55 and 7% of that is $0.178 per gallon. Then the feds charge $0.184 per gallon. $0.812 of that $3.159 is tax. Keep that in mind the next time you hear some politician attacking ""Big Oil"" and the high price of gasoline. "

Personally, I love how good companies adjust to the marketplace and make improvements. Whenever a new model comes out, you never know how they will change. And perhaps my own needs and wants will change too. Sometimes the changes that a manufacturer makes will mirror the new needs of a given customer, but sometimes not. When I was buying a car this time around, I wanted something that could haul a lot but also something that handled well. That eliminated suv's and trucks and knocked half the cars listed above off the list. I geuss the Accord stayed on my list since I had good luck with it in the past and it did handle pretty good. But in the end, brand had very little impact on what I bought and I'm glad. Having many good cars to choose from makes us all very lucky no matter what our balance of priorities are. "

Only repair items were a brake master cylinder and a new radiator (not counting a new muffler and exhaust pipe-spark plugs-other regular maintenance items). I always changed the oil regularly with Mobil 1, the trans fluid (again Mobil 1 tranny fluid) and Bosch Platinum spark plugs at 30k. This was one great car! Gas mileage was always 30 mpg+.

There is a very interesting book called ""The Reckoning"" that cronicles the rise of Nissan, and fall of the big 3 from the 50's to the 70's. A must read for those arguing the domestic vs foreign quality issue. To sum it up the Japanese had to make their cars better every year because they were so bad to begin with (they celebrated when they finally could keep up with a VW bug). The Americans, meanwhile, were so far ahead that their biggest concern was saving money on each piece that went into the vehicle, so they could maximize profits.Completly different cultures. One funny part was the Japanese wondering why their cars did not start in the U.S. when they would in similar cold climates in Northern Japan. It turns out the Japanese all covered their cars at night with blankets, and they figured the Americans did the same.As far as the current battle for the midsize sedans, it is getting hard to tell where the cars are made, and where the profits are going. I will say that cheaping out is not the way to go. I briefly looked at a Focus (despite having a Taurus that was not good to me) because of the excellent handling and the availability of a wagon. Everything just felt off. The seats were so soft like they had no springs, and the gauge cluster looked cheaper than the speedo I had on my Schwin. It seems to me the domestics are close in many ways, but they are often trying to cut corners in areas they think people won't notice. They do notice.One thing I do like about the domestics and about the Focus was the ability to order the exact vehicle you want (or close to it). They should push that angle. "

""here is a list of the 10 worst cars for holding their value. 9 of them are domestic, and 3 are fords. can you explain this?""I'd say there are several factors that can, alone or in combination, cause low resale value. 1) Perceived quality difference. I believe there is still, in general, a quality/reliability advantage that some makes have over others. (I believe it is mostly smaller than it used to be, and smaller then most people's perceptions, but those perceptions are what matter.)2) Heavy used supply from fleets. Some makes/models are heavily owned/used in fleets. Fleets' generally short retention means quick turnover and more used availability of those makes/models. (PS: Food for thought... Despite the lower resale value numbers, you wanna bet that those fleet models STILL offer lower overall lifecycle costs for the owners? Companies are obsessive about the bottom line; you can be certain that if it made fiscal sense for them to own/operate some other make in their fleets, they would be doing so.)3) The calculation itself is non-representative and inexact, at best. Those quoted percentages are all figured based on MSRP, not what you or anyone else actually paid for a vehicle. Makes that have more slop/incentives/rebates built into the sticker will show misleadingly low resale value figures. Caravan SE is on the list, for example. The first one I find on Fitzmall's site shows an MSRP of $19975, but can be bought for a no-haggle $15623. In this case, the resale calculation is done using an MSRP that is over 27% more than what I actually paid. So yeah, it's gonna look ugly calculated that way. But I didn't 'lose' that $4k+ -- I never spent it in the first place. "

I'm not complaining about brakes every 50k, just wondering how other people can go so long.Only repair items were a brake master cylinder and a new radiator As the family AAA tow record holder, it has also needed those things as well as 3 distributors, a starter, an ignition switch, and of course a main relay. Most recently, it pushed out its cam seals, making a big oily mess, but I cant really count that as the car is 15 years old and has 140k.I always changed the oil regularly with Mobil 1, the trans fluid (again Mobil 1 tranny fluid) and Bosch Platinum spark plugs at 30k.I have always changed the oil but not used Mobil 1 with that vehicle. Piston rings, oil seals, etc are fine, I don't expect a mechanical problem from the engine in that car. I also have had bad luck with the Bosch plugs (in that car and others). The Accord seems to like the NGK plugs called out for it, and even the Contour (which was on a hook once, for a water pump, at 130k) liked the Motorcraft/Autolite plugs the manual specified better than the Bosch ones.

 The decision to buy our 2007 SEL AWD V6 6-speed automatic Fusion was heavily influenced by professional reviews and ratings.With its $27,105 MSRP we could have bought an Accord or Camry, for example, but the ultimate deciding factors were style (looks), handling and features.Five months and 3,000 miles later we are still pleased with our purchase EXCEPT for the horrific 14.8 miles per gallon in-city mileage. The revised EPA rating for this drive train is 17 mpg city, 24 mpg highway. Unfortunately, 95 percent of our driving is in-city, stop-and-go, short hops.Naturally we hope that the Fusion will be as reliable as the Accord and Camry have proven to be. Only time will tell if Ford's new entry into the midsize market will prove to be a better idea. Our own personal experience with other Ford products has been generally favorable and we did not want a plain Jane-looking product.The Asian cars, in general, have a certain sameness to them while the Fusion is definitely bold and distinctive. It stands out in a crowd. Pride of ownership is a factor with any automobile. The fit and finish of our Fusion is exceptional and the car has many features only found on autos costing thousands of dollars more.Another factor was the dealer. Our previous experiences with Sherwood Ford, Lincoln, Mercury in Salisbury, Md., were A1. Having a good dealer means a lot in the long run.To be sure, the midsize sedan market is one of the most competitive these days and there are good things about each manufacturer's entry but the Fusion was the best choice for our tastes. Now, if the in-city mileage would improve to the revised EPA estimate, we would be totally satisfied.Boz "

However, I foolishly thought it might actually deliver the original EPA estimate of 19 city (since revised downward by the EPA to 17 mpg city). For the first 2,000 miles the car was stuck at 13 mpg but it has improved to 14.8.I didn't think a 4 cylinder would be powerful enough for a 3,200 midsize car but now believe I could have been mistaken, that we really don't need a V6 for the kind of driving that we mostly do.Hindsight is always 20-20. The EPA estimates for midsize V6s are pretty close together, I believe, within 1 to 3 mpg of each other.We consider our Fusion to be a great value as a midsize sedan, EXCEPT for the mileage. I expect we will have the car for seven to 10 years. We also have a 1997 V6 3.8-liter Thunderbird and an I4 2.0 liter 2000 Ford Focus station wagon, which I still love.I really liked the Honda Accord. My wife really liked the Ford Fusion.

I also started out pretty low when I first bought the car. I was getting 17MPG!! average and I was treating the car very gently. Don't forget to use the 5W-20 oil, keep your tire pressure in check too. Every bit helps. I am still really enjoying my Fusion. I am very up on maintaining this car. I wash it about once a week. Clean my interior leather with Maguires at least 2x a month ect.. I have Pictures of my Fusion on Carspace! I too like the styling of the Fusion it is very distinctive. :shades: "

Thx for the advanced warning Scape2. As a matter of fact our Oxford white SEL AWD 2007 Ford Fusion does have the dark charcoal leather interior so I guess we should invest in some windowing tinting huh?Do appreciate your encouraging words about the mileage, too. We have noticed that it is slowly creeping upward, albeit at a very slow rate. The highway mileage seems fine. It's just the 14.8 mpg in-city mileage that is the killer. Then again, neither the Accord or Camry even offers AWD, at any price. Subarus do, of course, but the nearest dealer is 30 miles away. "

if a fusion is rated at 'x' mpg, and car 'b' is rated at 'y' mpg, do you have a reason to believe vehicle 'b' would get better than the real world mpg, over the fusion?Nope, I don't believe the vehicle ""B"" would get better real world mileage than a Fusion. Indeed, I think the EPA's city mileage is terribly optimistic for all makes and models. I was just hoping that our Fusion would reach that level, which it has not done.I also believe people often fudge their mileage statistics. Some people might even believe it's impossible for us to get such bad mileage. It is a sad truth, though. Our best in-city only mileage so far is 14.8 mpg and for the first 2,000 miles it was 13.0, which was painful to the pocketbook.Our terrain is flat as a fritter. The climate is mild. The tires are properly inflated. My wife and I are conservative, gentle drivers. But the car only travels short distances at a time, barely even getting up to operating temperature. I doubt any car would match its EPA city rating given our usage.We didn't buy the car to be a mileage champ, just hope it will eventually do better than 14.8. We would be delighted if our Fusion actually reached the revised EPA city estimate of 17 mpg for this powertrain. "

With the kind of driving you do I would strongly suggest installing a block heater in your car. What? Yes, a block heater! This device is in almost any car sold in Canada due to the low temperatures in winter. I would suggest you use a timer and use the block heater for about 1 hour every morning, before the car is started.It will do wonders for reaching the operating temperature sooner and it will cost you less than 10 cents a day.Installation with purchase should not be more than 150 bucks at most. You won't regret it.I live near Vancouver, Canada and it does not get really cold here, may be 22 or 25 degrees in December and January. Still, I use my block heater (in a 2001 Toyota Echo and my 98 Chevy full size truck all year round and over 6 years the difference has been up to 8 mpg better in winter and 2 mpg better in summer. It more than pays for itself through gas savings, not to speak of being easier on the battery, the starter, the oil and the alternator. The heater works sooner and this is more pleasant to me, the driver. "

EPA already revised the numbers down once. Accord for instance would get 43 highway (I4 stick or auto) under the old system. They now subtract 22% to get the current 34 mpg.The new rating of 31 mpg is just absurdly low. Over 3,100 miles I average 30.9 mpg, and that includes day to day city trips of just a couple of miles each. I don't see how anybody can get only 31 highway unless they don't use their highest gear, or they are going extremely fast. "

there was an interesting story on this in CR about a year ago - talking about a more 'realistic' rating system and testing procedures that are badly needed. The outgoing current tests are done in a laboratory and are easily 'aced' by the mfgrs that can, in turn, 'program' their cars to do as well as possible. It's been a joke for years. Real City mpg turns out to be the hardest to match, highway mpg much easier. In any case, the 'worst' offenders in terms of overrated EPA numbers turn out to be the hybrids, followed by some of these V8 engined sedans with these gimmicky 'fuel saving' systems - like the 300C. The VW small diesel, interestingly, comes close to EPA estimates.In all cases, the numbers are, at best, relative to each other - as opposed to honestly achieveable. "

Fuel mileage is impacted the most by individual driving habits and traffic. If you do a lot of stop-n-go driving or short trips like boz (urnews) then you're going to do worse. The 2007 EPA tests did not use the A/C and the speeds were too low while the idle time was too short for today's average city driving. 2008 tests are simply more realistic. The only big change to the highway test was to add an acceleration run up to 80 mph.Nobody will always get the EPA average, even using the 2008 numbers (that's why it's called an average). As others point out the numbers were never meant to be absolute - only relative so you can compare 2 vehicles. "

Its about anticipating stops and starts; every time you hit the brakes you are converting $$$ (fuel) to heat.I also thing cities that don't time their lights (or time them poorly) should be fined by the EPA or get dinked on some type of federal funding (or given funding to fix traffic flow). If you don't have to lead foot it to make the lights, or spend half of your life idling at them, you get better mileage (if your not moving, your MPG is 0). "

Part of the problem is what people call ""city"" driving can vary a whole lot.if we all had to 'drive' in Manhattan, mileage would be more properly measured in gallons/mile? my Avalon, which is rated at 22/31, gets me 27 mpg overall with the benefit of about 70% high speed (80 mph or so) highway miles, about what I expected - a run of Suburbans I had which were rated at 13/17, regulary returned 15.5 under the same conditions. So sure, it is possible, to work well within even the current EPA ratings, but if I wanted to drive like Andretti, as one poster pointed out, I would likely be seeing maybe 20 mpg on my car - and a few speeding tickets! Andretti, notwithstanding however, the EPA test procedures on the City side are especially unrealistic when it comes to the 'gridlock' that many of us face day-to-day, those folks most likely to complain about it.

A friend of mine was looking for a new car and she was leaning on getting an suv because of the ability to fit a lot of stuff in it. She does a lot of yardwork and does quite a lot in terms of home improvement type projects so being able to toss bigger items into her car was something important to her. Because she did not like the gas mileage of most of the suv's that she was attracted to, we began to look at wagons and hatchbacks. I know that this was important for me since many times in my job, I'm required to bring large(r) displays that usually would not fit into a standard sedan. Also, I tend to get a bit impatient and don't like waiting for help to do something that I feel like I should be able to do. For example, getting my 42 flat screen the day after thanksgiving would have been hard to get anyone to fight the traffic and help me get the tv home. It was very nice being able to fit it into my mazda 6 hatchback despite the sceptical looks from the guys at Best Buy. I'm sure all of you know by now that I like cars that handle well, so an SUV with a higher center of gravity was not an option. Besides, I've read a high percentage of auto fatalities are due to rollovers which SUV's are much more prone. So in the end, she got a Subaru Outback. It's a great little car with an added advantage of AWD. I was suprised at how quick it was; acceleration from a stop was better than what I remembered when I test drove a 4 cylinder Legacy before getting the Mazda. It's a touch on the slow side, but then she's not so interested in enthusiastic driving either. All in all, it's a good fit for what she wants. And if she needs to toss her lawnmower in it or bookshelf, there's no stopping her. Since many people bring up how much space there is for passengers, I find that I am carrying things more than people so to me this is an important factor to consider. By opening up space, the amount of things I can do increase considerably. "

I considered the hatchback, but in the end decided to get the Mazda6 sedan. If we had not resurrected an old minivan, I'd have given the hatch a lot more consideration. As it was we decided on keeping the minivan for one of our kids to use for the next few years. After he no longer wants to use it we figure on keeping it for utility use and as a spare vehicle. So I decided to save the $1000 extra that the hatch costs, plus get a bit more headroom in the rear and not be forced to have a wing on the back of my car.But I agree with you that a midsize wagon or hatch does provide great utility and there are not many out there. The Mazda6 hatch gives you that utility while still being a great looking and great handling car.There is (or was) a Subaru Legacy wagon (a conventional wagon unlike the elevated Outback) also.

Some of you may have heard the news about Ford's Cleveland engine plants. From what I've gathered on other Ford dedicated forums, CEP #2 has been, or will be soon, re-tooled to produce what is called the PIP D30 engine. What is that you ask? Simply put, it's an improved version of the current Duratec30 engine and is rumored to be unveiled at the 2008 NAIAS in the 2009 Fusion and Escape. New numbers are all the result of speculation but internal Ford sources have claimed it will produce 240+ HP on premium fuel with a slight loss of power if you use regular. Direct injection is also rumored as are improved fuel economy numbers based on the new EPA tests. 3-4 MPG for both city and highway is what I've read. The latter is supposedly the entire reason for the update so definitely expect that to happen.The Fusion will continue on with the 6-speed tranny (no word on a manumatic) and the Escape with the 4-speed. Once the run is over for these two, both are expected to get the Duratec35 and the Escape a brand new transmission too. I thought that was rather interesting so I decided to share.  "

Ford needs to learn how to build smaller engines, stop falling back on whatever it is they have been doing for years (Detroit SOP), and stop producing cars with antiquated powerplants - it is no surprise to me that Ford is having trouble selling their cars and continues to close planta and lose even more money. They all have substandard 'old technology' engines.The Fusion has a number of good things going for it thanks to Mazda. Had Ford been able to even put the 233hp Sonata engine in it, 2 years ago, I don't think you hear nearly so many negative comments about it. How is it, do you suppose that lil ole Hyundai can do what Ford can't dream of? IMO a 'good' car has everything to do with the sophistication and engineering prowess under the hood and very little to do with styling details, or even improved relabilities, and especially how cheap it is. On that basis, the Honda 4 banger is head and shoulders above the rest for those folks that prefer such things, and the Toyota, Nissan and Honda 6s define what those sort of engines should be. "

Less custom tooling and such as well, especially if it's an OHC design.2 - Mercedes made a 200HP(NET, to the wheels!) 3.0L i-6 engine 45 years ago. Not in a racing car, but in their normal passenger car line. A 300HP VVT and computer controlled(as opposed to mechanical fuel injection, no less!) should be able to get 300HP quite easily out of a 3.0L engine. If not, slap a small supercharger on it. It'll still weigh less than the 3.6VVT(or about the same)The 3.6VVT is a good compromise, I guess. GM has a winner -- the next 3800 in that engine. MY only gripe is that they need to put more of the low-end torque versions like in the Lacrosse CXS in cars instead of the high HPO tuned vesions(CTS, etc). Honestly, the LaCrosse CXS is more fun to drive than the current CTS because of the diesel-like torquer curve(maxxes at something silly like 1400-1600rpm, IIRC)GM can do it, to be sure. I hope they do. But if they don't, well, life is tough and there are a LOT of things I care more about than car companies.Chrysler - lost cause.Ford - too slow to react, and also doomed to failure. They don't have the R&D that GM has on tap and their mangement isn't as willing to change as quickly(GM is retiscent but when it has to move, it can - Ford will whine and look for a change in the laws or regulations or something) "

Ford is only 'selling' (given the rate at which they are losing money maybe 'selling' and 'giving away' are interchangeable terms in Fordspeak) all the Fusions they can make right now because they are intentionally limiting production down there in Mexico. I assure that if the engines in the Fusion was even close to those others I mentioned, not only would the Fusion production and sales be up, but also that the price differential would be a whole lot less - apples to apples. If Ford truly wants to sell 'a better idea' they need to start with truly better drivetrains - in the process of producing a car that can justify a premium price.

Make a 300HP VVT I-6 engine. Stuff it in every car that you can.If even BMW can't make a naturally aspirated 300HP I6 then I really don't have much confidence in every other manufactures.That's including Toyota, Honda, Nissan, GM and of course, Ford.A V6 might not be as ""refine"" as the I6 but probably has more potential of making 300+ HP. Rumor has it that the Toyota 3.5L 2GR-FSE has the potential of making 350HP and Nissan already demonstrated that their 3.7L VQ can make 330HP. "

Another small (or maybe not that small) but important error. The 3.3 liter (Sonata and Santa FE) the 3.8 liter (Azera,Entourage van and Vera Cruz) V-6's AND the 2.4 liter 4 (Sonata) cylinder motors are totally new designed and manufactured by Hyundai. Further, Mitsubishi has not had a hand in any engine design (with the exception of the GEMA engine)since the late 80's as you correctly noted. Once Hyundai got going on car manufacturing they no longer needed help in engine design. The still used 2.7 liter V-6 is of unknown design...unknown by me that is, maybe Mitsu had some part in that one because it started life as a 2.5 liter earlier in the 90's. Small wonder then that many still discount Hyundai as a ""real car"" manufacturer. Many have facts stuck in the 80's and believe them to still be true. "

A new lease on life for a very dependable, durable millPrecisely what Ford SHOULDN'T do if it ever expects to sell competitive cars again.As the proud owner of a 2007 SEL AWD 3.0-liter V6, 6-speed automatic transmission Fusion ($27,105 MSRP) I find the car to be very competitive. All Ford vehicles may not be at the top of the heap, Captain2, but some certainly are. I see nothing wrong, or disadvantageous, with refining a good product to make it better. Besides, the 3.5 Duratec V6 has already been proclaimed by Wards Automotive to be one of the best 10 engines in the world. It just that FoMoCo can't produce enough of them to satisfy the need. Boz "

As many here know (but not all as you speculate)the OHV Vulcan 3.0 liter made its debut in the original Taurus/Sable in 1986 and carried on for years..no decades tweaked but basically unchanged. A pretty good engine at that if not that powerful @140-153 hp or so in its final form. "

oh yeah, quite a bit of difference, the pushrod 'Vulcan' a really difficult engine to love - the DT was a competitive engine when it first appeared in the 90s - the problem as I see it, is that it was not a solid enough design that it could improved (from a smoothness/refinement point of view) in the same way that Honda certainly has done with their SOHC VVTi or the Nissan VQ (which is older yet). Or maybe it's because that Ford simply couln't afford to do it. Ford's valve control system is incidentally very rudimentary compared to most of these modern engines (the 'i') and this may be one of the reasons why the Ford V6 doesn't feel or sound anything like those other engines - I don't know why, but can only judge the result. This all has very little to with HP and everything to do with the overall driving experience 'pushing' let's say a Fusion V6 vs. let's say a Camcordima V6. The old 200 hp 3 liter in the previous Camry also a pleasure to drive despite the power shortage only because it wasn't lacking in those refinement issues. The new 268hp 2GR is in a class by itself at least until Honda gets to work on the 08 Accord. The VQ, of course, redefined what these engines should be 5 years ago, predates the DT, and remains the standard by which these things should be judged, but IMO, slightly coarser and more strained than certainly the 2GR and maybe even that old Honda V6. The Sonata 3.3 surprised me in how refined (and powerful) it was, especially compared to the old 2.7 and not a whole lot different than the 3.5VQ in my wife's 03 Altima.Understand that this is a 'value' judgement kind of thing meaning that I happen to put a lot of importance on how an engine feels and sounds at high (4500+) rpm. I can understand those that might be perfectly happy driving anything with a DT in it, but, I simply don't believe thst those folks drive the way I do  "

Those folks that buy the Camcord I4s getting a better smoother and less bothersome engine and a whole lot better FE.But you said that Ford needed a more powerful V6 to be competitive. I say they offer the V6 at I4 prices to do that and improving that motor in every way helps that cause. In doing that they can potentially pull people away from an Accord or Camry I4 purchase because the Fusion will offer much better performance for a very minimal FE and refinement hit. Forget about competing with the V6 models. That market is very small.If they ever feel they need a souped up V6 to compete with the V6 CamCords then they can always offer some sort of sport model with a turbo or the 3.5L. I don't see that happening though.Ford is only 'selling' (given the rate at which they are losing money maybe 'selling' and 'giving away' are interchangeable terms in Fordspeak) all the Fusions they can make right now because they are intentionally limiting production down there in Mexico.Hermosillo can only produce about 300k vehicles per year at full tilt and they are at full tilt producing all three variants. They'd need another line to produce more and I don't even know if that's possible given all the plant closings right now. Production isn't limited in the way I think you were implying.I assure that if the engines in the Fusion was even close to those others I mentioned, not only would the Fusion production and sales be up, but also that the price differential would be a whole lot less - apples to apples. If Ford truly wants to sell 'a better idea' they need to start with truly better drivetrains - in the process of producing a car that can justify a premium price.So given Ford's current financial situation you think they can sell more cars by raising the price? Even if they improve the car they still have to keep the price down right now and attract as many people as they can to their lots IMO. That's certainly not the way old Henry did it. "

Our Escape Duratec30 was a bit coarse at high RPM but we rarely pushed it there because the low end was enough to get us around the local hills and valleys. The Mazda version was much quieter and free revving than the Ford version IMO. The Mazda also had an exhaust tuned to sound throaty which I think might leave the impression of a noisy engine on some people when it really isn't. "

a couple of things-I think it is far more likely that the Camcord buyer is shopping the I4 over the V6 because of fuel economy (and price) issues and not looking at the 4 cylinder as much of a power tradeoff BECAUSE those particular engines are every bit as smooth and quiet as the Ford V6.I don't know for sure, but I believe that the Mexican Fusion plant is not operating at capacity and nor has it ever - a condition that is good for Ford in the sense that it keeps supply down and demand up as high as possible. Chrysler has a big problem right now with overproduction and excess inventory.As Honda and Toyota keep proving, it is possible to sell things relative to window sticker and not relative to some rebate under invoice. It is not generally good for any car, the car buyer, and especially the mfgr. that they have to discount heavily. The only thing that is required to avoid this - a product that either IS GOOD ENOUGH (or innovative enough), or at least, perceived as being so and presto, the educated buyer will pay the price. Ford's problem, perhaps, is that they don't have the resources financially and otherwise to do any better. "

Note that I am not making a claim one way or the other with regard to the Fusion compared to Accord or Camry.

My understanding is that it is. Ford sold roughly 220,000 cars from that plant by 12/06. Capacity is 305,000 according to Ford's site so they probably are at or very near capacity to keep up with demand. Since the Zephyr changed to the MKZ and the Fusion added AWD sales have been up even more so far this year. Conversely, I've seen that Sonota sales are tanking. I've seen nothing official on that so I could be wrong.I think the price, with lower than average Ford incentives, is getting people in the showroom door right now and it's only a matter of time before word spreads. If that goes well then they may be on to something and nothing will help that more than some little tweaks to the drivetrain and content to keep things going. "

YEAH RIGHT is right and all you need to do is think about it. Your $5 grand is for the most part false savings because what that car you bought so cheap is worth a few years down the road will always be based on what they cost to buy new. Resale values have the biggest influence on what it costs most of us to actually own a car. The Accord in this group, which generally are bought within 2 grand or so of sticker, have the highest resale values and also tend to do very well in cost of operation numbers. Also the reason why heavily discounted cars tend to to very well in things like 'Initial Satisfaction Indexes' - getting that big discount up front does have a tendency to make us all feel more satisfied because we all feel at that point that we got somethin' for nothin'.

I realize all these times we've posted were not done by the same drivers, on the same track, and under the same conditions but it's all we have right now as far as an apples to apples comparison goes. Do you have the link to that 0-60 time for the Accord I4? I'm not saying you're wrong, but that sounds more like the manual tranny time. "

If they can get the FE close or the same as the I4s then what's not to like?No it's not everyone's cup of tea as you said previously but it could be a very smart move.

It is a competitive car which keeps looking better as Ford adds standard features, and the reliability reports are looking good. Resale value remains to be seen.However, the Fusion will absolutely require very substantial powertrain updates to remain competitive, especially with the new Accord just around the corner. I really hope Ford doesn't ignore it as long as they have ignored the Focus. That is a perfect example of a car that could have been a serious contender if it had been continuously developed and refined through the years instead of remaining basically the same.

Thanks for posting about comparing real dollars rather the per cent ages, which can be quite misleading. I just checked Edmund's True Cost to Own stats and saw that it lists the TMV price for a 2007 Sonata SE w/XM @ $20,706. We bought one on 2/24/07 at a purchase price of $16,651. (Both figures need to have dealer fees + TTL added; our dealer fees were $189.)Knock $4,055 off that TCO estimate and you'll see quite a difference. The financing, insurance and tax info. are also off the mark. If you finance $5,000 and I finance $10,000, my finance charges will obviously be more than double your finance charges. In CT, owners (or lesees) pay a property tax every year on their cars. The tax rate varies from town to town. My town's current tax rate is $21.65 for every $1,000 of the cars value. One town next door has a tax rate of (about) $62 for every $1,000 of value. Another bordering town has a tax rate of $17.89 for each $1,000 of value. (This also means that a car which has a lower ""value"" pays less property tax each year.) Insurance: forget what TCO says. How old are you, married or single, your driving record, what town do you live in, how do you use your car (not driven to work, driven to work how many miles?, business use), do you own or rent, do you have other insurance with the same company, have you been continuously insured for the last six months, FICO scores, etc. TCO and other similar estimates need to start off their comparison with real street prices, not an inflated number. But, your point about the $20K car being worth $12K in 5 yrs vs a $16K car being worth $8K in 5 yrs is valid. I don't pay my bills based upon per cent ages. The mortgage company, utilities, insurance company, etc. want REAL dollars, not per cent ages. "

mysteriously that Accord buyer is getting at least a good portion of his $5k purchase premium back says captainfunny you admit that you won't get all of that $5k back. And it stands to reason that you won't; a used car is still a used car and when it a buyer is comparing to new car prices used cars will always depreciate a lot. So if you want to pretend you're getting a car that's worth 5k more because you don't like the engine note of a car when I bet 99% of the time you're listening to the stereo and not the sound of the engine, more power to you. In the end, I think in the Mazda 6, the duratec sounds great. It has a nice growl to it that confirms that your intentions are being matched by the car. As automotive.com wrote about the Mazda 6 v6, ""The 3.0-liter V6 in the 6s greatly increases the fun. Like the four-cylinder, it has continuously variable valve timing (VVT) for its intake camshaft; but on the V6, this feature seems to be used more effectively, providing better low-down torque along with a willingness to rev, with good gas mileage and a nice set of sounds from the air intake and the dual exhausts.

And during the time I have this car, I will enjoy every curve, make thanks for great brakes everytime someone pulls out of a driveway in my path, and I will walk up to my car with pride instead of wondering which of 10 other simialar cars in the parking lot is mine as I load a big screen into my car while the other sedan owners make a second trip or pay for delivery.

fusion sales are still at the bottom of the barrel, and by a big margin. Its not that impressive to have a 205 sales increase when you only sold 45,000 the year before. Here's some numbers for you: rounded and year to date I don't recall ever saying Fusion sales were at or near the top. Did I? I know the sales numbers and already told you that the Fusion and it's sisters only sell about 220k units per year which is about half of the number of CamCords (each) sold each year. My point was that Fusion sales keep climbing and that is true. Fusion sales are actually at 52,000 units this YTD as of 4/30/2007. That's a 22.4% increase over the previous year. Why didn't you include the Sonata? It's sales are down 31% from last year at this time. See a trend? Also, Fusion sales to fleets are pretty low according to Ford and Hyundai just made some news about selling in high volumes to fleets IIRC. "

Ford is going in the right direction. They are building a solid, quality car for less than their competitors.

At idle I can't even tell its running. And in everyday driving its just as quiet as the Accord/Camry. Someone posted actual DB ratings way back in this forum.

Whhaaaaaaaaaaat? The Hyundai motor dates back to Mitsubishi designs from the 80s. They added variable valve timing, just like Ford did in the Jag with the DT (although why they didn't do it in the Fusion/Mazda6 I don't know)The 4 cylinder is all new, but its a GEMA motor, so its in Hyyndai, Mitsubishi, DCX, and others.Time to get better informed here. Just to summarize from other posts and add some add'l info:Hyundai's new Lambda V6s (3.3L & 3.8L) currently can be found in various Hyundai and Kia applications, including the Sonata. Competent engines and flexible, as the Lambdas can be tuned to as high as 300hp (which is a likely candidate on the base engine of the upcoming luxury RWD sedan next year).The Theta I4s also can be found in many Hyundai and Kia applications, including the Sonata. Don't be confused, these are not the same as the GEMA engines. Hyundai is, however, receiving royalties for these I4s.Bottom line, both the I4s and the V6s are designed in-house by Hyundai. "

I investigated the claim that cars with higher initial prices, such as Accord, cost less than lower priced alternative mid-size cars, when trade-in value is considered. Since my recent purchase was a Mazda6i, I compared this to Honda Accord. I bought my SVE for $16,100 and at the time I estimated, based on invoice less a $750 incentive that an Accord would have cost me $3300 more. I think that I got a better than average price, if so, perhaps a more typical price difference may have been about $2500.Then I looked at the price of a comparably equipped 2003 used Mazda6i vs. 2003 Honda Accord LX. The price difference with 60,000 miles ranged from $1400 to $1900, depending on condition and whether looking at private party sale or trade in. For average condition, trade-in difference was about $1500. With the assumption that a buyer would on average pay about $2500 less for the Mazda, this still leaves an average net advantage of $1000 for the Mazda6.Now, in any financial analysis, the time value of money should not be neglected. Today I can earn about 3.8% in a tax exempt money market account. $2500 invested at that rate, for 4 years will be worth $2800, so this increases the advatage of the cheaper car to $1300. The advantage would increase to more like $1800 for one who must finance the purchase at 7% interest.Of course, there is a lot of estimating and gueswork involved in this, but I certainly see no evidence that an Accord costs less when trade-in is considered. The Accord might cost about the same, at best, for some buyers...but this is certainly no reason to fear cars like the Mazda6, Fusion, Sonata, etc. "

How then can one state that Fusion fleet sales are climbing when the supposed Sonata fleet reductios are being based on a 5 month old statement that groups the manufacturers total fleet sales together? Based on news that's only days old we can say that Fusion fleet sales are falling I guess? See where I'm going?I know the Sonata is a great car, don't get me wrong. But if the American manufacturers start producing great cars, such as the Fusion, someone else is going to lose some sales. Looks like Hyundai might be the first victim IMO. "

never said that the Accord costs less - only that at least a good portion of the initial price difference is recovered at trade in time, that 'false savings' I mentioned. Intellichoice 5 year cost of ownership is $2000 LESS for a 07 Accord LX vs. the 6s, but I rather suspect they are assumming a higher initial purchase price (for the 6) than what your actual experience was. From Intellichoice's perspective, they would have no way to forecast how much money Ford needs to discount to sell the 6 (or the Fusion). In any case, total cost of ownership which obviously plays on resale values very heavily is every bit as important in evaluating a purchase as initial purchase price which may turn out to mean very little. Cheap now will almost always equal cheap later, and the reverse is also true. Lease rates tend to be indicative of what a car actually costs to own simply because new and residual values are both considered and assumes cars are both returned in excellent and low mileage conditions. Don't have any numbers in front of me, but I might be willing to bet you lunch that the Accord (or Camry) would have about the same lease payment on let's say a 3 year deal as would the 6, the Fusion or the Sonata.

I am very very sure of that - I own one in the slightly larger and heavier Avalon now 50k miles old . And you can cruise any forum you would like and find folks that can't match EPA numbers, especially on the City side, on any car. In my case my 22/31 EPA turns into an honest 27 mpg overall. My wifes Altima 3.5 I think was rated at 18/27 and she ends up right at 25-26 overall although her hwy percentage is high, she is a little gentler than I on the accelerator, and the land down here in Texas is about as flat as those EPA laboratory floors. Which is the bottom line, if you really do spend much time in City gridlock and also enjoy mashing the accelerator on these wonderful new V6s, you will pay a price - this applies even to the 4 bangers. I would estimate that for the average driver in normal conditions the net cost between the 4 banger and V6 is likely going to be in the 3-4 mpg range overall and roughly correspondent to the EPA rating differences - meaning that those driver that can't get close to EPA numbers on the V6 won't on the 4 banger either! On the Camry specifically this translates into less than $20 a month assuming 1000 miles at $3 a gallon. Well worth it, IMO, if for no other reason than a 'grins' factor  "

&#147;the numbers are wrong&#148;OK, to make sure we&#146;re on the same page, I&#146;ll take the Fusion V6 0-60 number from MT, and we&#146;ll look at C&D for the rest.Fusion V6 6A &#150; 7.2 sec, 21/29 mpg (MT)Altima I4 6M &#150; 7.2 sec, 24/31 mpg (C&D)Altima I4 CVT &#150; 7.4 sec, 23/29 mpg (C&D)Accord I4 5M &#150; 7.5 sec, 26/34 mpg (C&D)Accord I4 5A &#150; 8.1 sec, 24/34 mpg (C&D)Fusion I4 5M &#150; 8.1 sec, 23/31 mpg (C&D)Fusion I4 5A &#150; 8.8 sec, 23/30 mpg (est.)&#147;Your personal experience with the 5M in the Accord doesn't really matter when we're comparing auto trannies.&#148;Why can&#146;t we compare an I4 5M Accord with the V6 6A Fusion? Look at the numbers, Fusion is very close to the import 4's. The manual-equipped Accord I4 is closer to the V6 Auto Fusion (0.3 seconds) than it is to the manual-equipped Fusion I4 (0.6 seconds). The Fusion V6 isn&#146;t available in a manual, and can&#146;t really be compared with other V6s as the automatic V6 versions of Accord, Camry and Altima are quicker by at least 0.6 seconds. It appears to me that the Fusion V6 is a very close match to the Altima 4 with either the 6-speed or the CVT and the manual Accord. The point was made that the V6 Fusion is considerably faster than competing 4-cylinders, and as the Accord 5M and Altima 6M and CVT show, that's just not the case.Also, look at the Fusion 6A versus Accord 5M mileage penalty: 5 city and 5 highway! Those are EPA numbers, not even taking into account Edmund&#146;s forums posts of poor city mileage in late-model DT30s and posts of higher MPG in Accord I4&#146;s (my city average has been 28-29, and I don&#146;t drive lightly).So, it looks like choosing the V6 Fusion with the only available transmission (the 6A) over an I4 Accord with the 5M gives a less than 5% improvement in performance but reduces fuel economy about 20%! At 15,000 miles per year, assuming gas stayes at $3, thats over $400 difference, or about $35 per month. That's if gas stays at $3 per gallon... "

That could very well be. With aggressive discounting by Ford/Mercury dealers on the Fusion and Milan (e.g. I recently saw a Milan advertised for under $15k) and the new, improved IIHS test scores for the Fulan plus positive reliability data from CR, they could very well be taking sales from the Sonata. Many people will choose an American brand over a foreign brand (especially one with a dearth of brand equity like Hyundai) without even trying the alternatives. Also there are Ford dealers in most small towns in the U.S.--not so with Hyundai dealers. For $15k, I would be very tempted to get a Milan over a Sonata if I were buying a mid-sized car right how. "

What you ""said"" was:It is not generally good for...the car buyer...that they have to discount heavily.What is the intent of this, if not to imply that the cheaper car actually costs more?I've looked at intellichoice before and their data is just garbage...and not just based on my deal. They are more than $2300 too high on the initial price of the Mazda6. There has been $2000 in rebates available for at least 6 months, yet they have a ""target"" price of about $300 above invoice. This model can be bought effortlessly at invoice less rebates all day long. That site also can not account for the value of things like 0% financing that has been available from time-to-time on the Fusion.Based on looking at edmunds predicted resale values for the 6 and Accord, I agree that on a 3 year lease the net cost is probably nearly the same. I'd assume the Sonata and Fusion would be similar as well. At more than 3 years, though, I think the lower initial cost models would have lower net cost. My point is the higher resale value is not going to offset the higher initial cost. Therefore resale value should end up being non-issue for most. "

Why can&#146;t we compare an I4 5M Accord with the V6 6A Fusion?Because you and I were originally comparing auto trannies. You threw a manual tranny Accord time in there saying it was for the 5A and it was way off. I'm also taking price into consideration. The V6 Fusion is more in line with an Accord I4 5A than the 5M when comparing an LX Accord to an SE Fusion. I'm leaving the Accord Value Package out of the mix because it is more or less a ""stripper"" model.I get your point about the Accord 5M but the fact is, many more buy the ATX. I would buy the 5M and you would buy the 5M but when I address a broader audience, like that on these forums, I like to stick with what I think the norm is. So yes the performance hit isn't all that much with the Accord 5M but, given price to performance as the criteria, I can't see too many people cross shopping that with the V6 Fusion since it comes only in ATX flavor. I also never like using numbers from different sources because there are too many variables that are different and can affect those numbers in big ways. So, if you average out the different times reported from different sources for the Fusion you get about 7.3 or 7.4 seconds. Agreed? That's nearly 1 second faster than the Accord which is ""much faster"" in my book. I get fools trying to race my Mustang all the time so I am an expert in this field. :P "

Let's agree to disagree. From a dead stop, a manual 4-cyl Accord will hold its own against an auto V6 Fusion. They are close enough that it would come down to a match between the average drivers. In my experience from driving both cars, it is easier to get a good launch in my Accord manual than the Fusion 6A because in the automatic it was harder to get the perfect launch with just the right amount of wheelspin, without abusing the car. With the V6 auto it was either too much gas or not enough; manuals are easier in my opinion.Interstate races are much harder to judge. Did you account for reaction time, and how do you know what gear the manual Accord was pulling, etc.? Here, automatics have an advantage for the average driver. Example, if you pull up next to me cruising 55mph on the interstate and floor it, your car will likely grab second gear at high RPM for a breif burst of acceleration, while I'll hesitate to shift all the way down to second at that speed and fall behind.Baggs, the 7.9 second 0-60 time for the Accord I4 5A was posted on MSN Autos which frequently cites consumer reports. I agree, it is unusual for CR to get a better 0-60 time than C&D, but we are only talking about 0.2 seconds difference and that could have been testing conditions. Maybe C&D tested in CA at 75 degrees and CR tested in MA at 50 degrees. The 7.9 versus 8.1 second difference is minor, but I still took the slower C&D time instead. Besides, I'll bet than when the new Accord 4-cylinder automatic is introduced later this year, it'll run numbers similiar to the Altima, and both of them will be breathing down the Fusion's neck. With four cylinders! And, any improvements to the Fusion appear to be pretty far off.But as I've said before, they are both good cars, I almost bought the Fusion. "

What is the intent of this, if not to imply that the cheaper car actually costs more? there is no intent or even any implication - simply that any car that is generally sold at big discounts will, in fact, have a lesser resale value down the road. That is not good for the buyer only in that it reduces how much he/she might recover for the vehicle at trade-in time. It has nothing to do with Fusions/6s/Sonatas or anything in particular, just a simple statement saying that cheaper up front generally equals cheaper later. It is no secret that Honda and Toyota are hard to deal with especially if you are expecting 'Detroit' style discounts, but it is largely the reason why those cars tend to have high resale values - they cost more because they don't negotiate much. The guy that really gets screwed is that guy that goes out and buys a car when it first comes out, pays something closer to sticker, only to see the mfgr. rebate or finance at 0% in some sort of EOY clearance sale thereby making that car thousands less than what he paid.Resale value should be a primary issue for any car buyer under the proviso that he/she is not likely to keep a car more than about 3 or 5 years. Resale value starts becomings a non-issue once that car accumulated a bunch of miles and more age than that. And yes there are a number of examples where a cheaper car at purchase can and doesreally cost more - all depending on those kinds of things.My point thru this whole thread is that folks all the time point to a car that let's say costs them $3300.00 less new than Brand X or Brand Y, and then think they have actually saved all that money - to which I say 'well, yes you did, and no, you didn't.' And you are absolutely right, higher resale values will generally not offset the higher initial price (unless you bought a hybrid) and for whatever that real difference ends up being than that is really what it costs you to drive that Honda instead of something else - plus, of course, the time value of the extra money you had to borrow.

""The guy that really gets screwed is that guy that goes out and buys a car when it first comes out, pays something closer to sticker, only to see the mfgr. rebate or finance at 0% in some sort of EOY clearance sale thereby making that car thousands less than what he paid.""That is one of the things that steered me from the Fusion to the Accord. When I saw that I could get an Accord for under invoice, I was pretty confident that was the rock-bottom price; it was as good as I would be able to get on an Accord. The new Accords will be out in a few months, the 07s will be gone, and we likely will not see such pricing on Accords again until the end of the next generations life cycle. There is very little chance that in a few years my resale value will be less because Honda will be selling them much cheaper.The Fusion had a larger discount, but there was no gaurantee that the deal I was seeing would not have been eclipsed by some larger rebates, or 0% financing, plus a free dell computer, and iPod, or who knows what else they'll come up with to sell the things, and like captain said it'll drive the resale down faster.That happened to me when I bought my last Ford, but I didn't even pay anywhere near sticker! I thought I had a screamin' deal on my hands... paid invoice, less rebates, and got zero percent. The next year, the rebates doubled, zero percent financing was back, they had lowered the MSRP AND the invoice, and Ford had made standard some things which I had paid extra for. Guess what happened to my resale value? "

Resale value should be a primary issue for any car buyer under the proviso that he/she is not likely to keep a car more than about 3 or 5 years.That is where you lose me. Honestly, I am trying to understand why you think resale value is so all important.If the net cost is less for the cheaper car or even if it is about the same, why buy something you don't really want, just because the resale value is higher? For example, if after considering everything, excluding price and resale value, one likes the Fusion better than the Accord, why buy the Accord? "

Resale value is unknown. There are three distinct possibilities:Scenario one: The Fusion continues to sell well for the next 5+ years, without having increased rebates or fleet sales. Also, the LONG TERM reliability proves to be on par with Honda (or Honda reliability falters). In this case, the Fusion will resale favorably compared to the Accord, and since it was less costly to purchase, will prove to be the better value. In the end, it really will cost more to drive a Honda, and the ""Japanese Myth"" theory is confirmed.Scenario two: The Fusion continues to sell fairly well for the next 5+ years, with minimal rebates and fleet sales. Long term reliability is not too far behind Honda. The difference in resale vales between the two cars will be roughly equal to the difference in their purchase prices when new, taking the time value of money into effect, making the resale issue a wash. No car is the better value than the other.Scenario three: (JUST ANOTHER SCENARIO) The Fusion doesn't continue to sell as well through the next 5+ years; maybe Ford doesn't update it enough, maybe the competition makes great leaps and bounds. In response to lower sales Ford increases rebates, and/or sells to fleets. OR, the LONG TERM reliability isn't as good as Honda. The steep discounts on the future new Fusions, the older Fusions having reliability issues as they age, and used Fusions being dumped on the market at low prices, or any combination of those, come together to make a used Fusion worth considerably less than a similiar Honda. In that theoretical scenario, the resale difference between a Fusion and a Honda would be more than the difference in purchase price, making the Honda a better value. Like my last Ford, the costs of owning the Ford would be much greater than the costs of owning a competitor.Again, no one knows about future resale around or after 3-5 years from now. "

no one knows about future resale around or after 3-5 years from nowabsolutely true - but what we do have is about 15 or 20 years of established history whether that be Ford's history or Honda's. Resale values as used in those 'cost of ownership' studies are only estimates, even those residual values that are used to calculate lease costs are 'estimates' on the lessors part. Tomorrow we might have the greatest en masse sequence of engine failures ever known to mankind, with every Honda 4 banger blowing head gaskets simultaneuously.  At that point, those particular cars will certainly have resale value problems, wouldn't they? And every unfortunate Honda owner that happened to invest 20k or so of their hard earned money would experience a helluva financial loss, because now this car that they thought they could sell used for let's say 10k is now only worth half of that. Kind of reminds me of GMs dubious flirtation with diesels back in the first energy (gas price) crisis. Those engines darn near did all blow up simultaneously, and just like magic those resale values went into the dumper. "

Unless money means nothing to you, it is a good premise to strongly consider resale value of a car, if, and only if, you plan to keep the car equal to or less than 3 to 5 years. However in my case, I keep a car at least 10 years, sometimes much longer. Thus, resale value's importance is less of an important factor in the purchase decision.

If you read the latest sales news from Ford, a quick search will take you to several of them, they are reporting that fleet sales are down 5% for either the year or the month of April, I can't remember which it is.Maybe you forgot Ford removed Taurus fleet completely, so let's think about this logically. Ford operated 100% of Taurus to fleet this time last year, and fleet sales YOY are only down by 5% even with the removal of Taurus fleet, you do the math. For a good part of 06, Taurus fleet led in Ford car sales monthly, ran normally from 15-20K units/month. "

Resale value is unknown. There are three distinct possibilities: so true. One thing nobody has mentioned is the condition and mileage of the car. If you buy any car, put 45k miles a year on it, and trade it in after 3 years with 135k miles on it, you're going to seriously hurt the resale value. I don't car if its a honda, nissan, toyota, or bmw. You also have to consider the condition of the car. personally, if it knew I was going to be putting a lot of miles on a car, I'd buy a cheap as I could.But to me, the whole argument is moot. Your going to pay more for an asian car. Your going to pay more to buy it, pay more to maintain it, and pay more to fix it when it needs fixed. And if the dollar does't strenghen against the yen, your either going to pay even more, or the asian car companies will continue to see their profits decline. "

In 1992 the Taurus was the top rated car. I happened to buy a 92 Accord. After 12 years, and 140k miles, I decided to sell it and buy a new Accord. I sold the car in less than one hour for $1000 more than the KBB value ($5,000). Do you think I would have gotten close to that much for a 92 Taurus? I don't think so.

All of a sudden, resale value becomes very important. Say your cars value as determined by the insurance company is $8,200 while a competeting car in the same shape would have brought $11,400.

Me: ""From a dead stop, a manual 4-cyl Accord will hold its own against an auto V6 Fusion."" Scape: ""No, it won't.""Well, I've tried supporting my argument by stating that I have driven both cars and own one of them. However it seems we'll have to take another look at some numbers. Car and Driver clocked the 2007 Accord I4 manual as having a very respectable 7.5 second 0-60 time, slightly slower than the new Altima 4. I couldn't find much other data on 2006 and later (post engine power bump) Accord 4-cylinder manuals.The V6 Fusion automatic has plenty of test results available, however the results are all over the place. You are right, Motor Trend did clock one at 7.2 seconds, however there are many other credible sources that weren't able to acheive that time. Please read the following excerpts:Edmunds.com, Full Test of SEL V6- 0-60 mph 8.0 sec, Notes: ""We achieved our best time doing a ""street start"" with the traction control turned off.""NewCar.com- &#147;The 221-hp V6 engine provides enough power, although the Fusion will not likely be mistaken for a sports sedan. The Fusion can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in about 8 seconds, a reasonable performance though not as quick as the V6 versions of the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.&#148;Autoweek- &#147;In a straight line the Fusion turned in a respectable&#151;if average&#151;performance. Its 3.0-liter 221-hp V6 just edges the best our long-term Hyundai Sonata&#146;s larger 3.3-liter V6 could deliver, both to 60 mph (7.5 seconds vs. 7.51) as well as through the quarter-mile (15.7 seconds at 91.2 mph vs. 15.76 at 89.4).&#148;7.2 seconds? 8.0 seconds? 7.5 seconds? Even if you take the fastest time for the Fusion, versus the only time I found for the Accord, that's only 0.3 seconds difference. Between a 2.4L four, and a 3.0L six that has an extra gear! The results indicate to me that it would be a well-matched street race. Oh wait, I already did that myself (versus its sister car), and won. Seems to me like somebody just doesn't want to admit that a 4-cylinder Accord can keep up with his V6... "

I think he said generally import body parts would be more expensive. I think he may have also said that some cars have alternate body part suppliers, with lower prices. Since the Accord and Mazda6 are built here they should be toward the cheaper end along with other models that are asembled in North America. Accord might be so common that there are alternate suppliers.In the end, for me the make and model of the vehicle has little impact on determining my auto insurance rate.

However, your 0-60 times for the Accord 5A were just plain wrong and the Fusion V6 is a much better performer than the Accord I4 5A. Plus they are really, really close in price. .8 to 1 second difference is big no matter how you slice it.Those of you who have bought an Accord I4 5M are getting quite a performance deal because it is nearly every bit as quick as a Fusion V6 for $1k or $2k less. But I don't imagine many of you do have an Accord with that drivetrain so my point still applies to the vast majority.Oh I agree with you about there being a hundred factors which influence acceleration numbers.A lot of people don't get that though.

Agreed, on nearly all points. That Accord I4 5A time was probably fast by 0.2 seconds. A few things to consider, regarding the ATX to ATX argument: Altima 2.5L CVT is very nearly as quick as the fastest test of a Fusion V6 ATX. Also, I suspect the 2008 Accord (with the new A-VTEC engines and resulting power increases) will be able to match the Altima, closing the gap to the Fusion unless Ford has some new tricks. A-VTEC promises to increase economy as well, where the Accord already has a distinct advantage (I am seeing 28-29 city and 34-38 highway). "

Accord (with the new A-VTEC engines and resulting power increases) will be able to match the Altima, closing the gap to the Fusion unless Ford has some new tricks.Well, that brings us back to the whole origin of this and other conversations I'm trying to clear up here. The new PIP D30 engine for the Fusion and Escape will, if all the news on Ford forums are correct, have more horsepower and better fuel economy with no hit in price.A CVT is a completely different animal but it is the closest thing to an ATX Nissan offers in the Altima right now so I'd say that's fair to compare too. 99% of Freestyle owners I've come across say it has plenty of power for them with the CVT (which is gone for the Taurus X and D35 motor BTW) and that's a heavy vehicle with a relatively weak engine. So something good has to be going on in a CVT. I've never driven a CVT equipped vehicle, so I can't attest to the magic they perform.  "

Now the nearest town with any kind of traffic congestion is about 200 miles away. I go years at a time between waiting more than one cycle for a light. :P As far as cell phones go the Accord is quiet enough that I can just put it on speaker. Love the drivetrain in the I4 manual. Nice and quick, but still give Focus like fuel economy (or better). My lifetime mpg is 31.3 for my Accord, and 40 mpg is obtainable on the highway - 35 mpg under poor conditions. Still, I was another that looked at the Fusion. It is a nice drive, but the dash and switch gear are below my 1990 Acura, seemed a little more cramped than the Accord, and mpg was not there.

If Hyundai cut back on its fleet sales by 60%, their April '07 sales of 10,434 would have had 8347 retail sales and 2087 fleet sales. Using your 50% figure, April, '06 sales would have been 7858 retail & 7858 fleet.Cutting back fleet sales to a total of 20% is not unrealistic. :P "

That Ford should be 'rewarded' 'by a hit in price' is silly. For what, maybe making an engine that is borderline competitive, 5 years too late?

This isn't the right place for this, but Ford, GM, DCX, and Toyota plants are not of the same breed. Ford is now finally converting it's plants to support flexible manufacturing which will also lower re-tooling costs and time. Right now that's just not the case. Did you read that article I posted about the PIP D30? It is going to take them a little over a year to re-tool the Cleveland engine plant #2 to prpcude that engine. Toyota does not have to deal with such downtime because their plants are much newer.FWIW, the other DT35 engine plants are set up to switch between building the DT35 and DT37 variants with little or no downtime as I understand it. They are taking their sweet old time with the new engine but I think we can all agree that they have to to get it right. And should. "

Mazda did but I don't know that Ford will.having never driven a 6 but obviously with a lot of bad taste in my mouth for the Ford DT3.0- correct me if I'm wrong, - except for the blown 4 banger, Ford and Mazda drivetrains are identical, even to the point of coming out of that same Ohio factory? Ford can't do what it wants or needs to do because of some nasty labor contracts as well as horrendous losses in the last few years. Toyota can do and did obviously what it needed to for pretty much the opposite reasons. It takes money to make money, and Toyota sure has beaucoups of that. If it takes Ford another year or two to get a lousy 240hp V6 out, it will be too late, as usual and the Fusion (so equipped) will be a market afterthought - if it isn't already.Remember that when the 500 came out hampered by the same engine, Ford promised then that they would have a better engine for it for the 06 model.

Aside from that, Hyundai's fleet figures are average at best. The purpose of the Sonata program, and I'm paraphrasing Hyundai officials' words - to get as many butts in the Sonata as possible Most automakers do not have fleet/retail split model-by model readily available, and for good reasons  But, I will try to see if I can get confirmation from one of my buddies who works for Polk. For now, based on my conversations with various industry professionals, Sonata fleet units have been reduced since the purposeful program ended, while Fusions went up. "

yes, the only thing I've seen on the 3.5 engined 500 are car show photos and a promised April 07 date as apparently an 08 model. In the meanwhile dealers continue to give away 500s off their lots at $5000.00+ discounts. The Five Hundred, IMO, is in much the same situation as the Fusion, a good overall design courtesy of somebody else, but both saddled with an outdated powertrain. Whether the bean counters are now in the background, I don't know, but it sure doesn't seem like it.

I'd be willing to bet the difference in the alti 0-60 time (and other speed tests) is entirely because of that. and on a separate note, with a lot less moving part, and generaly simpler design, repair/replacement costs are much lower.

The grill seems tacky and cheap--black plastic of a not particularly pleasing shape. Like a Fusion without the chrome.

I have not driven a Honda or Toyota lately so I can't compare unfortunately.The motor is mfd in the same plant as the Ford DT30s but it is different in several key ways. I have to wonder if the PIP D30 motor I speak of is in fact some newer version of that Mazda V6 as the next Mazda6 will get the DT35, and a good bit of length added, from what has been printed several times.

and isn't captain's impression of the DT30 based on the Ford Five Hundred, a car that weighs 500 pounds more than the fusion or 6? If I remember correctly, his comments from several months ago were about a different car that may or may not have similar characteristics as the Fusion or the 6. Try driving a Honda Pilot or Nissan Xterra and tell me you can't hear that the engine is stressing a bit more pulling all that extra weight compared to the sedans with similar engines. To give you an idea of how smooth the mazda6 engine is, today I accidentally drove about 10 miles in 4th going around 70mph before noticing and shifting up to 5th. 4k+ rpms does sound more aggressive in the mazda, but the thing is, I WANT IT TO SOUND LIKE THAT WHEN I REV IT UP THAT HIGH. Passionate driving should involve your senses; what you hear influences what you feel. If you exceed 4k rpms, you're doing it for a reason, and an aggressive sound simply is expressing your intentions. But when I want to be serene and smooth, I will keep the engine below 4k and get comments from people like my uncle who drives a lexus saying that they are surprised at how quiet the Mazda 6 is.That, to me, is one of the great things about the 6...it can be quite civil when you want it, but when you're in the mood for fun, it has great grip and balance through curves, amazing brakes along with an engine that propels the car nicely. Oh yeah, for 5k less than an Accord. "

The wife and I bought a 2007 SEL AWD V6 6-speed automatic Fusion on Dec. 4, 2006. The MSRP was $27,105. Other than the standard SEL equipment and the AWD, it has heated leather seats, anti-lock brakes, and a moon roof.My wife refused to consider Asian cars and the only one I was really interested in was the Honda Accord. My question is: How much Accord could I have gotten for $27,105? A V6? Moon roof? AWD is not available, of course. The Fusion comes in three models, the S, SE and SEL and there is a choice of two engines, the 160-horsepower I4 2.3 liter with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. The 3.0-liter V6 only comes with a 6-speed automatic.My wife and I, to some extent, believed the Accord to be priced out of our range for the options we wanted and the standard SEL features on the Fusion (too numerous to list all).This car has been delightful so far, 3,000 miles and no squeaks or rattles, no breakages, nary a problem EXCEPT for very poor (14.8 average) in-city gas mileage. Unfortunately, 95 percent of our driving in in the city, stop-and-go, short hops.I am having second thoughts now. I am wondering how much Accord can be bought for $27,105. The Fusion's bold, distinctive styling and superior handling qualities were big selling points as was having a top-notch Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer, Sherwood of Salisbury, Md.Granted, now is not a good time to go shopping but I might be in the market for an Accord within a year or so.

I just wrote about the Accord with Navi because even the Navi-equipped Accord would be less than the $27k our Fusion-buying friend mentioned. Unfortunately, it appears he didn't know about the incentives, or the MPG penalty AWD would beckon. He got a nice car though.Graduate,Actually I did know about the AWD penalty. The original EPA in-city estimate on the window sticker was 19 mpg, which I could live with. Believing that was my first mistake.Since then, the EPA has revised its estimate for this power train downward to 17 mpg city. I could live with that, too. It's the 14.8 mpg that we are getting in city driving that is killing me.Bottom line: We should have ordered an SEL with an I4, either manual or automatic, instead of buying what was on the lot. I didn't think the I4 would be powerful enough but, according to numerous posts on various forums, it would have been just fine for our purpose. "

Interesting that of the top 8 cars, there's two Kia Optimas, two Hyundai Sonatas, two Fords (Fusion and Five Hundred), the Aura, and the Accord. I think it reinforces how competitive this class is and that if people bother to look beyond the ""automatic"" choices of Accord and Camry (and maybe Altima), there's several very good cars and good values in this class.

That's a very good point, Backy. I also found it interesting that the Fusion placed fourth (the I4) and fourteenth (the V6). The reviewer obviously places more value on the four cylinder models. Indeed, we now wish we had ordered an I4 SEL Fusion rather than buying a V6 off the lot.Your point about the diversity in this mid-size sedan class is well-taken. I really wish we had been able to read this information before we decided. We would have saved several thousand dollars and been better satisfied to boot. "

No you didn't buy the Fusion too fast. Don't let the Honda crowd get to you. You have a very well built vehicle at a good price. The Fusion fit/finish is every bit as good as an Accord or Camry.

I had 4 - 5 sales people walking, poking, opening/shutting doors ect around these cars looking at every detail. I am totally confident the Fusion will easily hold up over 100,000 miles. In fact.I just got back from a trip to Idaho in my Fusion. I wanted to post this so badly!! I traveled with my whole family. 2 Adults, 2 children, soccer gear/luggage.

You made a great choice in buying a Fusion. Nobody seems to be saying otherwise. Instead, that they bought the wrong Fusion for his/her needs. 14 MPG when they don't need V6 power or AWD is pretty sad, when the 2.3L Fusion would've sufficed. Out of curiousity, do you realize that it IS ok for people to disagree with you and it not be personal? There always seems to be a chip on your shoulder. Sure, the Fusion will hold up 100,000 miles, as should any car on the market today. Anyone saying otherwise is just trying to push your buttons. I'm glad you got above EPA numbers on your trip. I just got back in my Accord and did similarly to you! 36 MPG, 75 MPH (through the Ozark Mountains), 100% A/C use. 2 MPG better than EPA with 700 lbs of load in the car. Just proves that with the right driving style, the EPA numbers aren't as bad as people say they are. With better conditions (for both of us) the numbers will only climb (I've seen 40 MPG twice in my 4-cyl, I'll bet you might see 35 if you drove closer to 65 MPH).Hey, urnews (I hope you read this so I'm making your name big ), you mention your Fusion's sticker, but you never mention what you actually paid for it. Since Accords are going consistently $1,000 and more under invoice, I'd guess your Fusion did too, making your deal better than the $27k you are telling us about. Fill us in!

We bought the car Dec. 4, 2006. All toll, we paid $16,180 for the $27,105 car.Had we been smart, we would have ordered an SEL 14, 5-speed manual and waited a few months until convertible season (higher trade-in) arrived.I would be much happier if the car just delivered average  miles per gallon, EPA-estimated 17 for in-city driving, which is 95 percent of our travel. I don't believe that is every going to happen. We made some bad choices and are just stuck with the result. It was a cash deal. I figure the dealer made out like a bandit.We also should have considered the Accord more closely. We just automatically figured it would have cost more when equipped like the Fusion. The AWD was a big mistake. Our climate is moderate, with very little snow each year.The best way to describe our situation is ""buyer's remorse.""

Given that your avg. mph is only 16 on this tank, that implies that you either you drive in a lot of stop and go traffic with a goodly number of signals or stop signs, or you sit in traffic and your vehicle idles a great deal. Either way, it would seem that your driving is definitely not conducive to good mileage, even with a gentle foot on the gas pedal. What I would suggest you try, if possible, is to try and replicate the EPA test cycle and see what happens. Here is a link to the test variables:EPA Test cyclesWhen you get there, click on the tab ""Detailed Comparison"". The table listed will show you the the major test variables the EPA uses to determine mileage. If you can find a way to replicate the environment and test and then your vehicle still falls far short of the city mileage, then maybe there is a problem. Chances are though if you can replicate the test you will find that your car can meet the test results. Either way, maybe it will help reduce your ""buyer's remorse"".  "

have a 213 CI, 268 hp engine in a 3600 lb. car that consistently gets me 27 mpg overall on EPA ratings of 22/31. Could I fathom a set of conditions where I might only average let's say, 12 mpg - sure. It's called stop and go traffic and gridlock. Take your AWD Fusion DT V6 out on the highway and drive away a tank at 65mph, if it doesn't do closer to 30 mpg I would be surprised, and there may be something wrong with it. It is a relatively economical engine, although you have certainly penalized it with the AWD. EPA ratings really mean little except in relative terms, the fact that they are not realistic measures for many drivers and/or driving conditions is something that's been going on for 30 years or so, I find it difficult to believe that you wouldn't know this.That little 4 banger you yearn for probably won't crack 18 under those same conditions your V6 is getting less than 15. Given that you apparently drive very few miles, suggest that the V6 is not really costing you much at the pumps - put a pencil to it - it may help with your 'remorse' - but don't think that the 2.3 4 cyl is going to come close to its city ratings either - at least for you.

Captain2,We have taken one 360-mile road trip with the 2007 SEL AWD when the car had 1,200 miles on it. It yielded 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning. Average speed for the entire trip was 60 mph or so.Dealer road tested the car with an on-board computer hooked up at 1,500 miles and got 24 mpg at 50, 60 and 70 mph during a 12-mile run. Shop foreman pronounced it to be AOK, according to specs. He provided computer printouts of the testing. At the time, the car was only getting 13 mpg. Now, with 3,200 miles, it is getting 14.8 mpg.The original EPA estimate for this power train was 19 mpg city, 26 highway. That has since been revised to 17 mpg city and 24 highway. AWD is the culprit.I have no doubts that the car will deliver the EPA estimate for highway travel and am equally sure that it is never going to yield 17 mpg in our city driving. I might as well shut up about the situation and live with the fact that we bought a gas guzzler, by today's standards.Our 2000 2.0-liter I4 Ford Focus station wagon only delivers 22 mpg in city driving over the same route pattern and our 1997 3.8-liter V6 Thunderbird averages 13 mpg over the same course.This being a 2007 model, I just naturally figured the Fusion would at least meet the EPA estimate. Obviously, that was flawed thinking on my part.Worse, these averages have been achieved without the AC on. I imagine there will be a 2 or 3 mpg penalty for that as summer arrives. An all-black interior won't help any even though the car is white.I still like the styling of the Fusion better than any of the other mid-size sedans but am convinced we should have gone with the I4 and that AWD was a very bad mistake.What's the expression, live and learn? Well, I have learned a lot since Dec. 4, 2006. If we ever do buy another vehicle it will probably be an Accord. Might as well go with the flow. All those millions of other buyers simply can't be wrong. "

The mpg should not be the same at 50, 60 and 70 mph. 24 mpg at 50 mph is especially low - something is wrong. My Accord 4-cyl stick shift is close to 50 mpg at a steady 50 mph.

most folks can match or better EPA highway at 60 mph, which is effectively what you did do on that trip you were talking about. 24 or 25 mpg highway is a long way from a 'guzzler' IMO, although I think there are some larger sedans with V8s in them that may do what your Fusion does. I don't believe that Ford or any other mfgr. has any ability to 'cheat' the EPA tests any better or worse than they all already are. While it may be true that a Honda 6 (or 4 FTM) are more efficient engines, I can't imagine the Accord doing much better (FE wise) in your particular case. The DT 3.0, while I certainly don't like the engine much, is known for its reliability and relative FE - you may just be paying a big price for that 'gimmicky' AWD. "

I had a similar type drive to work...rarely did I drive more than 20 seconds without having to stop at a traffic light and my mph never went over 35. It took me 15 minutes to get to work and there were a few hills that I had to negotiate. My car at the time also had AWD and was a 2.5 liter Subaru, and I was usually around the 15 mpg mark when I was using the car to only go back and forth from work. I was driving my mazda 6 with a similar engine that you have along that route for a while and actually got better mileage (about 16 mpg), although my 6 is a manual transmission. I now take a different route to work that has less stops (although a little longer in distance, it takes less time if I hit the traffic lights right). Since there is a bit less stop and go, my mpg is up to 18. On longer drives with mostly highway, I get 27+ usually. Even when I took it to some really curvy roads with lots of hills and was almost always above 4k rpms in second or third gear, I got better than 20 mpg. So the distance and type of driving is killing your average... as others on this board have pointed out, there are not many cars you could get epa #'s with given your short distance with lots of stop and go.

While I don't know that ""gimmicky"" is the right word for the AWD option I do believe that the mpg culprit. The car was equipped that way on the lot, it's not something we consciously ordered. It snows very little, if ever, in Salisbury, Md. But I suppose all-wheel drive may be a factor any time the front wheels lose traction, such as wet or sandy conditions.The people who have the 3.0-liter V6 without AWD on the several forum where I participate generally seem to get good mileage. I seem to be the only exception, although a few owners with AWD have likewise reported poor mileage.I will say that the car handles exceedingly well but we did not test drive any other Fusion. That was a mistake. The dealer only had eight Fusions on the lot. This was the one we liked best. We should have ordered one rather than buying what was in stock.Several people have suggested the power train will not be broken in until the car gets to about 5,000 miles or so. We are at 3,200 now. I am pessimistic about that.  "

While I don't know that ""gimmicky"" is the right word for the AWD option I do believe that the mpg culprit.I am guessing that the AWD system in my MazdaSpeed6 is similar or identical to the Fusion AWD.

You need to look at the other factors in your situation; your commute traffic route is likely the biggest factor. Here in the mountains of Colorado I have been very pleased with the AWD this past winter. The only way I can get a wheel to spin is to break the whole car loose by flooring the gas pedal while driving in very icy conditions. It performs very similar to my wife's Audi Quattro. "

'gimmicky' only in that few drivers will ever find an effective use for it and the manner in which it is employed in what really are FWD cars. The vast majority (I would guess 90%) of the population of this country, do not regularly see road conditions (snow/ice covered roads) bad enough or frequently enough that the extra cost/weight penalties can truly be justified and/or proper driving techniques in a std. FWD (or even RWD) wouldn't do just fine. That said, there is a good reason, why Subarus sell so well in your part of the country. In the mountains of Colorado, you as part of that 10%, would certainly understand the benefits of AWD or, even better, 4WD - but for the majority of us I'll stick to the contention that is a waste of money and gas - and a gimmick of sorts. Further, normally these systems route well over 90% of the power to the front wheels anyway, only pushing power rearward (up to maybe 50%)in the event of loss of traction at the front, again an infrequent occurrence - unless, of course, you live in Colorado. While there is no doubt that AWD systems and/or stability control systems have become the rage, I question not only the need for such systems but also the rather invasive way these systems (SC) can be implemented. While there is no doubt that a computer may 'save our bacon', I look very suspiciously at a 'computer' making those kinds of decisions for me. "

With today's technology, etc..I wonder if perhaps some of the manufacturers set their computers to show increased MPG results with increased miles. I know the engines ""free-up"" or break-in or whatever, but I am wondering about more than that. Could they be setting the computers to show better MPG as we go down the road??

If mpg is important to you, maybe you should go to a Honda dealer and see what kind of trade they'll give you on the Fusion. You might be able to get into an Accord I-4 SE 5 speed manual for not much money at all...The I-4 i-Vtec manual Accords are said to get close to their epa ratings of 26 in the city and 34 on the highway. My less advanced 02 Accord I 4 manual, with the regular VTEC engine (before i-VTEC), gets about 23-25 around town, and about 30-33 on the highway (70-75 mph, ac running, fully loaded with four passengers and luggage). Or, perhaps wait for the all new 08 Accord which is rumored to have the new Advanced VTEC engine. The A-VTECs are supposed to have more power, and 10% higher mpg. So that might mean as high as 28 mpg around town and as high as 36 on the highway. Of course, those all new A-VTEC Accords, which look a bit like a 5 series BMW, are probably going to be selling at close to list price for a while....I'm going to try and wait until the summer of 08 when they might be had at a bit of a discount.

AKirby,Allen, we do drive ""normal,"" as in gentle, conservative. But perhaps our average usage -- short commute, stop-and-go, short hops -- is not normal. There is a difference between the two entities, in my humble opinion.Maybe nothing, except a hybrid, would make a difference. All I know is that 13 mpg for the first 2,000 miles or so was financially painful and 14.8 mpg now is not much better.I would not recommend the AWD option to anyone, unless they live in upstate New York or one of the snowy climes. AWD is a waste of money at the outset and a mileage killer in the long term, which is more money down the fill-up tube.Our decision to buy a car equipped this way was just plain stupid. It was a ""fuelish"" move on our part. That's what happens when you see a car you ""just have to have."" FoMoCo does not equip many of its SELs with an I4 and a manual tranny but you can order one that way, which is what we should have done.An I4 manual might not reach its EPA estimates given our driving pattern, but at least it would have been cheaper to operate overall. Hindsight is always 20-20, unfortunately.According to my calculations it will cost us $524 a year EXTRA to operate at 14.8 mpg versus the revised EPA estimate of 17 mpg. But that was figured out when gasoline was ""only"" $2.22. It's now at $2.74 a gallon and rising almost daily. That only increases the pain.I pity the people, ourself included, who are stuck with vehicles that deliver low gasoline mileage.If there is a next time, I will opt for an Accord. "

Why don't you try to trade the Fusion in for a Fusion SEL I4 and see what happens?I am very curious as to why you feel buyers remorse? I understand your MPG issues. What other reasons for remorse?Scape2,We are not going to do anything, as far as trades go, for at least one model year. Maybe, as you say, the mileage will improve as the Fusion matures. If it would just get 17 mpg, the revised EPA estimate, I would be satisfied, really.Our (my) buyer's remorse is solely related to the mpg situation because that is a dollars and cents issue. The Fusion is fine otherwise, a genuinely outstanding car, the best we have every owned. (The large turning radius takes some getting used to and backing up is tricky because of limited visibility. These are factors that you learn to make adjustments for.)My wife could care less about mileage. Maybe I should adopt that outlook, too. But I just can't. It bugs me big time. If there is a next time I will definitely opt for a four-cylinder, manual transmission something.I (we) believe the Fusion to be an exceptional automobile, EXCEPT for the mpg issue.

Don't believe all the hype about Honda 6's being more fuel efficient. Our '06 Honda Odyssey doesn't come close to manufacture estimates of 20 city/ 28 highway. More like 17 city and 21 highway.

I've read that most of the emissions that come from a car happen in the first 5 minutes of operation when the car is not up to temperature... so I wonder if this has something to do with cars having poor mpg when driven short distances. But I'd have to agree with others that have suggested a hybrid probably makes the most sense for the type of driving you have described. The Camry seems to be the standout hybrid in the midsize department at this point. But if you trade your car in on another for the next few years, I would imagine you would be upside-down as far as trade in value is concerned. the money you would lose by trading in too quickly would easily pay for your gas for a few years. To be blunt, there really aren't a whole lot of good options for you right now. If your drive to work is longer than your wife's, perhaps it might make economic sense to trade cars with you driving the fusion?

Yes, Zzzoom6, it is a very nice car in all other respects. The poor mileage is its only flaw at this point. We don't even have any squeaks, rattles, shakes, etc. The fit and finish on the Fusion is 100 percent.We'll most likely keep the car until the 2009s debut, at least. Who knows maybe the mileage will magically improve at 5,000 or 10,000 miles, even though I doubt it.I'm retired, but my wife (12 years younger) still works. There is only one commute involved, hers, and sometimes she takes our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon to work. It delivers 22 mpg over the same driving pattern. That is below the EPA estimate, too.As you suggest, a hybrid would be an ideal vehicle for our circumstances. I will definitely explore that possibility the next time around. Who knows, maybe there will be a decent Fusion hybrid by that time.Oddly enough this is the only four-door my wife would really consider. (She had her heart set on a Mustang, but that was just not practical enough at this time.) We actually owned two Mustangs in the past. Neither were particularly good cars and we did not keep them for very long, but they sure are sporty.One of the former Mustangs had a pathetic four banger in it and it was severely underpowered. That's why we went for a V6 in the Fusion. According to what I've read on three Fusion forums, the I4, 160-horsepower engine is more than adequate.Indeed, most of the fours available in the mid-size cars today seem to be quite adequate, according to what I have read.The bottom line is we should have ordered an I4 manual SEL rather than buy the $27,105 MSRP car that was on the lot. We were smitten with the car. You know how that goes.I was also interested in the Sonata but the wife considers all of the Asian makes to be ""plain Jane lookalikes."" The Fusions styling, handling and good press reviews turned out to be the deciding factors.Heck, I even think the Prius is so homely as to be attractive in a perverse way. Wife can't stand them. As I mentioned in an earlier post, she doesn't even care about mileage. (I'm in charge of filling up the cars and paying for it, so why should she?) "

I have to take disagree with you on this issue. I have a '03 accord with a 6 cylinder and I have averaged 25-26mpg on mixed driving. The manufacture estimate is 21 city/ 30 highway and although I have owned the car for over a year I have never had an extended highway trip to check the mpg. I have gotten 29mpg on half a tank of highway miles and the rest my normal commute. That is better then the '02 Maxima I had which I averaged 22-23mpg (Granted the Maxima was a 3.5l and the Accord is a 3.0l). The best I ever averaged on only highway mileage 27mpg in the Maxima.  My brother has a '04 Mazada6 with a 6 cylinder and 5m he is averaging 25mpg on 80% highway mileage. With a 100 mile daily commute he wishes he was getting my mpg. He also wishes he knew Mazda was going to release the Speed6 before he bought his 6 cylinder.  We also have an '05 AWD Pilot which my wife drives and she averages 18mpg on more stop and go traffic. On vacation I have averaged 22-23mpg going 75-85mph on strictly highway driving. We have been satisfied with mileage considering the size, weight and AWD. IMO Honda does build a good compromise between power and mpg in their 6 cylinders. "

again referencing multiple testing by multiple publications, almost all tests of things like lane change and/or skidpad pad abilities lately have been showing up with an asterisk next to those numbers - the asterisk - stability control inhibited. Even CR (who would figure to champion such systems) now grudgingly admits that SC can and does limit ultimate evasive capabilities. My point being that there is a really really low probability that SC system intervention might also 'cost you your bacon', in lets say a high speed avoidance manuever - depending on how the intervention levels are set by that computer programmer in the first place. That said, things like this are certainly more likely to work for you than against you but the buyer needs to understand that it is not a free ride from a performance standpoint and especially that while it might make his car safer, it is not improving handling (stability yes, handling no). What I've read only confirms a coupla of experiences I had. Following a successful 'heart in my throat' accelerating high speed avoidance manuever (swerve) in my own non-VSC car, I did take an opportunity to test VSC personally as installed in a Sonata (don't ever buy a rental car that I have had a chance to play with  , my cornering exit speed (on a favorite traffic circle of mine) was 10 mph less (VSC on vs. off) because the car 'went dead' as I approached those computer imposed limits for that particular car. There is no way that the Sonata system would have 'allowed' me to do, what I did do several weeks earlier in my own car although I can't definitely say if I would have been involved in that particular pileup or not. Incidentally, many of those VSC off switches do not completely disable the system and I know of no cars that wouldn't automatically re-engage the system when restarted - making the 'off' switch largely impractical anyway.

Perhaps as it should be you say...

I found this to be the case in a 545 BMW I drove, the car is a computerized 'nightmare' and seemingly ties SC intervention points into the 'ride' settings you set after going thru what seemed to be 23 submenus on the silly 'i drive' computer. A 'sport' setting would tighten the suspension and also raise the intervention level on the SC. A good 'sports sedan' will do things that nobody short of Mario Andretti would dream of trying and still not incur the wrath of SC. The Hyundai, (or any of the other cars in this group) OTH is by no means a sports sedan, despite Hyundai's rather ludricrous ads trying to compare it to one, or Mazda's earnest efforts at trying to be one. So therefore, as the car's capabilities are less, so too must the intervention levels be adjusted, keeping in mind of course that anybody that spends that kind of money on that BMW is rightfully expecting performance beyond what is generally available, while that Sonata is being sold as a 'family sedan' for the masses. Don't know that I could ever bite on a computer controlled SC system 'enhancing' (kdshapiro's word) anything, only that those particular cars are so dynamically superior that they don't need to get in the way in the hands of anybody with even an ounce of sanity.

SC can't always save your bacon either. If the traction is not there you will still go off the road.I played around with it this winter on our sienna, and in snow and ice it was very easy to get the back out at quite extreme angles. If you car has the ability to brake just one wheel to bring you back on course it won't do any good if that one wheel has little or no traction available.We bought the option as a safety feature, but pushing the car to the point where it might intervene is asking for trouble because it might not be able to save you. It is really for emergencies.Having said that I am quite comfortable in my non SC Accord 4-cyl. It is not quite as nimble as my Integra, and has lower cornering limits, but it is very easy to drive fast. It has a nice progressive power on understeer and power off oversteer. Meaning if you go into a turn too fast (within reason) under power and notice you are going wide, then just take your foot of the gas and the front end pivots around. This is quite intuitive as taking your foot of the gas is your first instinct when things look to be going awry.My Integra has similar traits, and I always had a lot of fun hanging the tail out in the snow (I always run 4 snow tires, so there was some traction).

It is not worthwhile to compare mpg from different drivers driving under different condions. MPG will vary a lot depending on how and where a car is driven. For most midsize cars CR will routinely gets 14-16 mpg in their city test. Meanwhile EPA has gotten 20-24, for the same cars in their test. These large differences are just due to the way the car is driven in each test.The guy with Fusion remorse, likely drives more like the CR city test rather than the EPA test.

The good indicator is that urnews got 22 MPG on the route his Fusion goes on now. Whoa, TheGraduate, not I. But I wish it were so. Our SEL AWD 2007 Fusion get 14.8 mpg in city driving. On the one road trip we took, 360 miles round trip, we got 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning.For the first 2,000 miles on the car we got an insane 13 mpg. The 14.8 figure is an improvement achieved over the last 1,000 miles. The car now has 3,000 miles on it.I'd have a pleasurable heart attack if the Fusion ever delivered 22 mpg in city driving. You have me confused with someone else. The revised EPA estimates for this power train are 17 mpg city, 24 highway.The people who are squawking the loudest about the Fusion's poor mileage are the AWD owners. Regular V6 and I4 owners are reporting descent mileage.My wife (who doesn't really care about mileage) and I really like everything else about the car, are totally satisfied.Our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon, I4 2.0 liter, 4-speed automatic, delivers 22 mpg over the same commute route. That's a little low too, but not so noticeable. "

Interesting that none of you who are spouting off about stability control could explain how it works.In a car it senses whether the car is understeering (you're turning left but the car keeps going straight) or oversteering (the rear end starts to slide around) and corrects it by cutting the throttle or torque and/or applying brakes to one or more wheels. In the case of understeer (on a left turn) it will apply brakes to the left rear wheel which will pull the front back to the left in line with the steering input.This is monitored with a yaw sensor and requires 4 channel ABS so that one wheel can be independently braked. Since the Fusion (and I assume the Mazda6) only have 3 channel ABS they can't do it. The next generation will have it. I believe Ford has committed to have it on all vehicles by 2010.Lincoln had stability control on the Lincoln LS way back in 1999. It was obviously not judged to be important enough to mandate the 4 channel ABS in the CD3 cars. "

Some of you don't seem aware of the EPA's new ' 08 CAFE standards and estimates. They are significantly lower. Most folks we know with new vehicles from HD trucks and SUVs to family sedans do not get the EPA sticker estimates in real world.I find the Consumer Reports numbers to be closer to mine but our Highlander Hybrid can be driven in such a way that we can get 26 -28 mpg. Car & Driver published a long term test of the Lexus 400h and the editor in AZ averaged 27mpg for several months while he had it. BTW, our Hh and the 400h have blazing acceleration - 0 to 60 in 6.8 seconds with fully charged traction batteries. The other SUVs that are this quick suck gas like crazy.On ESC - NIHSTA is mandating it for all passenger vehicles sold in the US by 2010 or 2012.

As far as SC setting go in the the 545. I could not get it to activate regardless of what the driving setting was, probably due to my own lack of nerve, skill, respect for traffic laws or possibly the fact that it is a friend's car.

That is the way to use the EPA mileage estimates...if you get less than the rated figure now, expect to get about the same amount less with your new car. Apparently some think that if the EPA sticker says 19 for their new car that this means they will get that, even though their old car has an EPA rating of 26 and they get 22 with it :confuse: . I have seen this sort of comment before, where someone is complaining about the mileage in their new car. Then you ask what they drove before and what their mpg was and it turns out it was getting just as much below the EPA numbers as the new car.When I turned over my old Windstar to my kid to drive the mpg dropped from the 19 I had typically been getting to 15 or less for him. This is because he drives 3 miles to school and 2 miles to work, while I drive 9.5 miles to work.I noticed that it seems that the CR city test is actually much harder on 4 cylinders than V6s. For example the Fusion I4 gets 23 city from EPA, but only 15 from CR. The V6 Fusion gets EPA 20 and CR 14. So the I4 drops by 9 mpg and 39%, while the V6 drops by ""only"" 5 mpg and 25%. "

Lawyers and computer programmers will have a say how you drive your car. and this is really where my problem is - those lawyers and computer programmers have no idea who I am and from a driving perspective what I'm capable or not capable of. I never said that SC wouldn't save a bunch of lives (particularily the single vehicle kind of accidents). The 'low' tolerance settings on many of these SC systems is much more common than you think, and not necessarily just based on that Sonata I 'tested'. Many Sonata owners here, I'm sure, would testify that they have been driving their cars for a year or two and have never experienced any SC intervention. In that particular car it is not that invasive, in BMWs (MBs and Porsches come to mind as well) case I guess we are going to agree that it is not invasive at all. Toyota/Lexus both seemingly take a more aggressive approach in their SC programming perhaps heeding their lawyers advice too much. There is a reason why a non SC AWD Fusion V6 will outhandle and be more fun to drive (despite having maybe half the engine) than a softly suspended FWD Camry XLE V6 equipped with SC - and it is not just because of the 'loose suspension'.

Hope this isn't a new Honda Accord.. or they are going to be in really big trouble.. What a surprise, you don't like the Honda. I could've bet money that you wouldn't!If you ask me, it is one of the more cohesive designs in the class. Beats the Camry handliy (what's with that beak on the hood, and the fluffy look of the body?). If Toyota can sell 450,000 Camries, Honda won't have a problem moving this Accord design unless the interior goes downhill.That's ok. I'm struggling to see the Saturn you are talking about in the front end though, I really am. If anything, I'd say it has a mix between the TL and the Odyseey in front-end design.Styling is all purely subjective, as we all know. "

Midsize sedans, or manufacturer news & views?I find it very entertaining that you think people don't buy a car because of the media.What bad media has there been about Ford products? The media doesn't typically make a big deal about mid-model changes. Honda added horsepower and redesigned the rear of the Accord COMPLETELY. I didn't see an article about it until a comparison involving the new 2006 Fusion, and even then, the article wasn't about the redesigned Accord. "

To be fair, It's a reputation they've earned. Personaly, I think the accord is a very good car, and worth the extra money you (usually) pay for one. came very, very close to buying one.

I got the 2.5s. so far, the car is great. The CVT is amazing, I really think its going to be the future of transmissions. Whats nice about it is, It deffinitly makes the car move faster. Its hard to describe, but it always maintains the perfect gear ratio, without having to dog the engine, and can do it with such ease. I guess the best way to explain it would be tachometer (at any speed) can fluctuate from 1500-5000 rpm in a matter of seconds, just by how much gas you give it. You can be cruising 60 mph at 1800 rpm, push the gas in all the way, and the engine will rev (in an instant) up around 5000 rpm. But as soon as you let off the gas, it will drop back to about 1800. And you never feel it at all. You could almost confuse the tachometer with the speedometer. And driving it normally, I'll often notice that the rpms are going down while I'm speeding up. very weird. :surprise: The I-key is also pretty neat. Totally impossible to lock you key in it. Lock and close the doors with the key inside, the car automaticly unlocks all four dors and starts beeping and screaming at you. leave it in the trunk and close the lid, and the trunk automaticly opens itself. The car will also give a warning on the HUD if you close the door with the car running if the key is not in the car. That way, you won't drive off without it.As for the milage, I've been driving it mostly mixed, and getting about 29-30 mpg. But I haven't done much open road driving yet, and I've heard the milage isn't as good the first couple thousand miles. Supposedly the car is programed to burn a richer fuel mixture for a couple thousand miles for break-in purposes. "

Sounds like a great car. I didn't realize the keyless ignition did all that, what a smart idea. I've nearly closed the trunk on my keys a couple of times, and caught it at the last second. I've been in a car with CVT once in my life (a Honda Insight of all things - what a tiny tin can!) and it was the weirdest thing to me as well, although I'm sure I'd get used to it. 29-30 MPG is about what I average in my 06 2.4L Accord and that is a mix of city and highway, without being real racy in my style (4,000 RPM is tops for me most days). Sounds like your Altima is returning similar mileage, with a little more horsepower! Sweet! "

In my zip code the Accord EX V6  is $25,164 on carsdirect.com. The Fusion SEL with the options you list is $22,327 there...adding moonroof (Accord EX has that, right?) puts the Fusion at $23,019. This is about a $2100 difference. The Fusion can also be had for $1000 more with 0.9% financing for 36 months. For most this will be worth more than the $1000.The Accord is in it's last year, in a few months the difference will likely be at least $3000. I think the difference in price between Accord and cars like Fusion/Milan/Mazda6 is typically at least $2000 and as much as $3500. I know I paid $1700 less than carsdirect price for my Mazda6...this is $3800 less than carsdirect price of the comparable Accord. I suspect, at least in my market, that the Honda dealers would not discount to $1700 below carsdirect price, as the Mazda dealer did...but even if they did, the Accord would still be $2100 more than Mazda6.

I drove this before I drove a Civic stickshift, and haven't gone back to another since then.Being a manual tranny enthusiast I'd like to address this one. Every car we've bought in the past 11 years, 4 total, has been a stick. By far the worst shifter was in our '96 Civic (EX with VTEC) so I hope Honda has improved them since then. It had to be connected to the transmission with rubber bands. I have no other explanation for it. I'm sure the Civic you drove was much better than a truck but it was not a good experience for me.Actually I take that ""by far the worst"" comment back. The shifter in our '98 ZX2 was a bit rough too but not rubbery like the Civic's.Since then the cars we've bought have gone up in status I guess you could say. The Mazda6 shifter was pretty nice but it's clutch was tricky. Our Mustang's Tremec T56 is like heaven compared to any of the others however. Given the press the Accord shifters have received I don't doubt that the shifter is nice. Let's just be careful of how much praise we give to Honda transmissions though. I personally don't feel their track record is as stellar as we're sometimes made to believe and I'd bet others would agree. Besides, for about the same price of a loaded Accord you can get a MAZDASPEED6 with, from what I've read again, a shifter that's hard to beat.I do applaud Honda for offering an MTX with the V6 in the Accord though. Not many mfrs do that these days and it gives guys like me hope for the future. My kids are still small and fit in the Mustang just fine. Someday that will change and I'd like to have something great to fall back on at that time. :blush: "

That is interesting. But I have a correction to make to your Fusion price. I used your link and zip code, and after adding ABS and Trac Ctl, Moonroof, Heated Leather, the top-end sound system with Satellite Radio, the price was:Target Price with selected options: $23,385copied and pasted from CarsDirect. Not sure what options you left off of the Fusion, but the Accord has all of the above standard (I selected the AudioPhile sound system because Edmunds' stereo evaluation ranked that system below the Accord EXV6's standard system). $25,164 - $23,385 = $1,779.For $1,779 you get 23 horsepower, a smoother sounding engine, a more curvaceous interior without controls that can be found in many other models, Stability Control, and the best resale in its class.Of course, for someone who drives their car 20 years, doesn't want stability control, likes square interior designs and a more growling engine and don't mind lowest horsepower in the class (which is still plenty), the Fusion might just be money well-spent!It is all about personal taste and how you perceive the car. Scape asked me earlier to ""quit trying to convince everyone that the Accord is cheaper than the Fusion.""I've never said that, and if I have, please show it to me. What I'm trying to do is just encourage people to read the Honda Accord Prices Paid forum. People report prices, often times, their initial quotes. When there are high prices, such as $27,500 for an Accord V6 with Navigation, other buyers will step in and tell them they can do better.Of course an intial offer is going to be higher than one you negotiate, because some people are still convinced that Hondas go for near sticker price. Once people learn that they aren't, and enlighten the dealer to the knowledge they hold, the negotiation process takes a turn for the better (for the consumer). I've read that forum regularly, and the people getting the best prices are doing something very simple. Just bouncing internet quotes from one dealer to another until the best possible price is reached. No traveling from dealer to dealer is involved! "

The reason you get a basic model(and the same VP with automatic is only $600-800 or so more) is that the chassis, suspension, brakes, and engine are all the same as the other models, or very close(the VP is missing a rear swaybar, but that's easy to add back in for a couple of hundred dollars - bolts right in).You can get the same shifting, engine, and driving experience as the 4 cylinder EX for a silly low price.Now, the clutch isn't fantastic. I'd rate it as good, though, or close to what you get in a typical European entry-level sport sedan. Definately a step up from everything else in this price-range, though. Not rubbery, not clunky.

One of the things that seem to negatively affect resale values seems to be how much a new car is discounted. Now that the Accord has discounts higher than I can ever remember would suggest that those who currently own an Accord will now have worse resales than before. I would think the coupes would be hit the worst since the styling differences between the current and next generation are the most dramatic with the next gen looking really good. Since most of the styling on the new sedan still appear to be on the sedate side like the current model, I doubt the style differences will result in a extra hit in negative resale. "

Of the top 3 high-points I've found out of my 06 Accord, exterior style wouldn't be one of them (although I think it is nice looking, it isn't ""beautiful""). The best attributes I've found were:Interior design/ergonimic layout. The inside looks like a car costing more, to me.Powertrain. I have the 2.4L, and that engine is so sweet all the way to redline! Lots of pep, and fuel economy that belies its size and pep.Suspension tuning. This one surprises me (in a good way) the more miles I drive in it. The Accord had the right balance of sporty handling and smoothness on the bumpy interstate for my tastes. Tauter than most midsizers, but softer than the Fusion and 6.Since I spend most of the time INSIDE and DRIVING the car, these were three very important attributes to me. Lots of standard safety features were a bonus.

I really liked the ride and handling on the Mystake. Also it was a 5-speed stick with ABS and traction control, a very rare combination on a moderately-priced I4 car in 1995. But it was in the shop many times for various glitches and recalls. And the residual was ridiculous. So I didn't buy it after the 2-year lease ran out. "

I've always heard similar things about that car (the Contour, anyways). Based on what I've read (I've never driven one), the Contour offered dynamics similar to the Fusion, which is a good thing if you actually ENJOY driving .A 5-speed manual with ABS and traction control is a big deal to find on a 4-cylinder car NOW, much less 1995. What a find! "

Yes, although one of the things that always impressed me about the Gen 3 Elantra was that it offered that same combination (stick, ABS, traction) at a very low price point.Maybe the reason the Contique had such a good blend of ride and handling was that it, like the Focus, was designed to be a ""world car"", e.g. sold in Europe also, in this case as the Mondeo. I liked the way the Mystake drove so much that I almost bought a V6 model when they were being phased out, because I saw some offered (loaded) for around $12k. But then I thought about all the shop time. Plus I never found a V6 5-speed in a color I liked, at the closeout price. :blush: "

This completely blows a hole in the ""too expensive"" argument. Hmm...does this completely blow a hole in the Honda does not put incentives on the Accord and lower the resale value arguement too :surprise: . Isn't it a sign of a problem with future resale value for the Accord when (based on 4 cyl SE) it is discountred more than a Fusion in CA? The Accord SE is selling at about $3500 below MSRP, while the Fusion is at about $2300 below MSRP.There must be some sort of dealer incentive in CA, In my zip code, the Accord SE Automatic shows up at $19,946 on cars direct. The comparable Fusion SE with AT and ABS is at $18,349 and the comparable Mazda6 SVE with AT is at $17,840.It's not a ""too expensive"" argument (at least not from me), that would be a subjective judgement. The fact is the Accord costs more than a Fusion or Mazda6, to some it is worth the extra cost to others it is not. I'd have passed on the Accord, even if the price were the same as a Mazda6. However, if the Accord were $2000 less than the 6, then I would have surely given it more consideration than I did. "

Well, considering the Accord's resale is best-in-class and that rebates are being offered only now that it is due for a complete overhaul, I'm gonna say it sure doesn't seem to be a problem. I'm not trying to sell my Accord at the moment, so I'm not going to talk about something in detail that I really don't know about for sure. Those selling their Accords (2003-2007) should feel free to chime in and fill us in though. I'd be interested to know if the rebates are making that big of a difference in resale. "

Cars.com established the Lifestyle Awards to recognize which vehicles were best suited for the lifestyle needs of today's car buyers. After an exhaustive analysis, the 2007 Honda Accord was named the Best New Car for Small Families. According to Cars.com, ""The Accord is the most well-rounded midsize sedan &#151; the class of choice for families who want out of SUVs and their high fuel costs. The Accord has it all: good gas mileage, predicted reliability, quality, comfort, resale value and crash-test results. It's even a little sporty. The four-cylinder should do the trick for most buyers, and the optional V-6 will please the rest. The Accord is a best-seller, and for very good reasons."" "

Have a four cylinder Optima, and IMHO, this is the only compelling deal with Kia. Unless they are REALLY discounted, I'd buy the Sonata if I was interested in a V-6. There is very little power difference between the six and four with the Optima. All you get is an older engine that is more complicated, has a timing belt, and uses more gas. If you want fancy, Kia does put a four into the EX. I was able to get an LX with after market leather (which looks very good), and seventeen inch Michelins for sixteen grand. Other than power seats it gives up little compared to the EX. "

Today a dealer near me has an add for Mazda6 SVE, presumably manual trans, at $13,995 (can one get even a civic at this price?). This is about a $6000 discount from MSRP. The dealership with this ad is always very straightforward when they advertise prices (which they don't do very often), so pretty sure there are no games associated with this...the only ad-on (besides TTL) would be a $99 document/service fee. Clearly carsdirect is not giving a good price on this car...total discounts plus rebates of $5000-6000 off MSRP have been available all year. Honda dealers around here tend not to advertise purchase price much, instead they advertise leases. So I did not see any prices for that model. Three year leases for VP are advertised at $199, which is also advertised for Fusion S...both have similar deposits, etc. required. This is more evidence that for short-term owners there is little difference.For the Fusion, ads are showing only about $2500 off MSRP, including the $1000 rebate, for general customers. They have some special college student and lease renewal rebates also shown in the ads for another $1500 off. "

The Accord SE is selling at about $3500 below MSRP, while the Fusion is at about $2300 below MSRP. ****IIRC, there's no difference or discount out here. Just that there's a LOT of margin in Hondas between actual cost and MSRP. Several thousand in fact. Even the Fit has a good thousand or so margin.But I don't really care, either - if Cars Direct is selling it for that low, it's legitimate. I think the price difference is how close to a major city it is/some sort of delivery charge. Try typing in a major city like Saint Louis or Altanta.With Cars Direct, if they say ""target price"", it means they don't have it in actual inventory/a real price to offer you. When they have inventory sitting around, the discounts are much higher - so you often have to try several cities in your state to find the best price. And this is true for individual models as well - so an Accord VP may be hard to find, but a LX will be all different price ranges. But ther are some deals to be had. OR you can haggle, though Cars Direct is good to show them, because they have to beat it if they want to make a sale.  "

You're right that the present generation is more conservative, especially the early models whose rear quarters resembled Buicks. The new one is better.The late eighties cars were truly cutting edge.

The Legacy is my personal favourite, its a really under rated Camry/Accord alternative. It is available with a six speed manual, looks really good, has a turbo charged engine, what more can you ask for? You actually control the car, when you steer the car you feel where it is on the road, you feel how its handling, how it is breaking. Instead of getting no response and completely unresponsive, mushy breaks on the Camry. The Camry is really just an appliance, a white good. It will never be as fun or good looking as the Legacy or Aura. It maybe good quality, but there is no soul there, no passion. Something I need in a car. "

not that invoice means too much (generally about MSRP*.9), but any car mfgr out there (that is making money), will generally not exceed 60% in direct mfg. costs including labor. So therefore this $20k Accord that invoices for $18k, likely costs Honda maybe $11k to make. This rest, of course, goes to cover overhead, insurances, taxes, and profit. If those kind of margins bother you, than you better stay home and keep your money in your mattress - these kind of margins are normal for anybody that actually manufactures almost anything. If you are expecting even GM/Ford/Chrysler to base pricing on actual cost to manufacture, or even feel that they aren't entitled to it - about all I can say is don't hold your breath.And sure, the fact that Honda is discounting a little more than usual right now on the last year before a model year change is not strange at all - and will have a negative effect on resale values - although I would be willing to bet that resale values won't go down (on a percentage basis) as much as the 'drive out' prices have - making them even more of a true 'value' then they were a year ago.

Well, considering the Accord's resale is best-in-class and that rebates are being offered only now that it is due for a complete overhaul, I'm gonna say it sure doesn't seem to be a problem.Someone else can probably verify but IIRC Accords were being discounted $3000 - $4000 last year during the end of the model year run. I do remember Edmunds showing a ""Manufacturer to Dealer"" ""Marketing Support"" incentive of $3000 and I'm pretty sure it was as high as $4000 at one time. As I understand it, this cash is not on the hood but is available to the dealer if they really need to make sales. So not everyone saw it when they bought an Accord during that time last year. I'm not writing this to imply that there's a problem with the Honda resale formula mind you. I just wanted to point out that they do at times offer a good bit of cash even if it is handed out at the dealer's discretion. Cash like that also allows them to print those outrageous ads showing a car for a crazy low price, then you walk in the door looking for that deal (the bait), and finally walk out with a different car (the switch).

And sure, the fact that Honda is discounting a little more than usual right now on the last year before a model year change is not strange at all -agreed. its easier for them to rebate heavily now at the end of this generations run. You have to figure all the design and engineering costs have been paid for. From what I understand, when a company makes a new car, or redesigns an existing one, the guess how many units they will sell of it. They use that number to spread all the development costs over. being as the accord probably sold a good bit more units than anticipated, it probably generates more profit than it did 3 years ago. and, there is more room to lower the price.

Fit/finish was actually very good. doors closed with a solid sound, panels looked all tight and well put together. Dash was well laid out. Plastics felt a little flimsy at places. Drove pretty nice however for a family sedan. Power of the V6 was ample. You weren't going to win any races, but it pulled the car just fine. Overall, not bad. Would I buy one.

Even in the last Altima Coupe review on Edmunds who's biggest point was it's sportiness, they chose to compare it to the Pontiac G6 (presumably because it is a coupe also) but not the true solid handling car in this segment the Mazda6. Most of the press that the 6 is getting over the last couple months has to do with the next generation which won't be released for another year! So I geuss I'm not surprised the Mazda6 is being discounted so much, but that does offer some good opportunities for the value shoppers or those who desire a stylish midsize car that's fun to drive.

Yes, I think the 6 is a great buy and a mostly a secret. I really only discovered the 6 myself because of the Fusion. I had really liked driving the contour and have ususally found Ford seats to be comfortable. So I was anxious to try the Fusion, thinking maybe it would be the new contour. I really liked driving the Fusion and seats were comfortable, but did not care for the appearance...so after finding out it was based on the 6, I tried out the better looking parent.I have a, just graduated, kid that may need to replace a car soon (my old '95 5 speed manual Contour with 150K mi), if she gets a job and needs a car to get to it, I just may encourage her to consider a new mazda6 rather than spending $4-5K on a junk-mobile...$14K for a nice new car like the Mazda6 SVE is a fantastic bargain, IMO.

But they need that profit to pay for the development of the new version!!! thats part of the profits. the way I understand it, when pricing a car, the manufacture factors in the actual cost of production, a certain of profit margin, and the development and engineering costs divided by the number of units they expect to sell. Now, if the car sells twice as many units as expected, the pre-production costs will be paid much earlier and the profit margin will increase quite a bit. Hence, they can lower the price and still maintain the originally desired profit margin. That would explain the heavier discounting in the last year of production.thats just speculation on my part, but does seem to explain why the price of top selling cars seem to drop in the last year.

the 'Japanese'mfgrs. have a heftier profit margin because they are not so bogged down in 'suits', labor obligations etc. and because their US plants are newer and more efficient. Cost of production is less and the overhead is less. A situation that is changing as the 'American' mfgrs. become 'Canadian and Mexican' mfgrs. now largely operating out from under the UAW.GM in its 'banner year' of 05, it was said they were losing $2500.00 on every car they sold, a number that precisely equalled just their pension obligations per car. And a good part of that loss was due to GM having to 'sell' their cars at 20 or 30% discounts - quite a bit different situation than we are seeing with Honda right now. Invoice, that admittedly ficticious number, will generally always be between 10-15% below MSRP (2-3k in this group), I challenge you to name any car that is more than that (they are published numbers). Buying anything based simply on how much 'haggling' you can do, is however, dangerous in that you are much more likely to end up with an inferior product, and also may not really be saving you any money at all simply because cheap now will usually equal cheap later. I feel sorry for those folks that ran out and bought a 6 let's say at 'invoice' only to find the same car available several months later for 3 or 4 grand cheaper eefectively getting 'upside down' on their car notes in a real hurry- a chance you really take when that badge doesn't say Honda or Toyota.

Based on what I've read (I've never driven one), the Contour offered dynamics similar to the Fusion, which is a good thing if you actually ENJOY driving.I actually found the Contour to be more aggressive than the Fusion. The 95-97 SE V6 MTX had a default sport suspension that was, well, sporty. Doing dumb things (lifting in a turn) brought the back end around, but using good form (trail braking, etc) got the car to rotate perfectly. It proved to be a great companion for HPDEs and autocrosses as well as a daily driver. The Fusion, relative to the Contour, is similar to the 90-93 Accord vs the current Accord design. A bit bigger, a bit more bloated, a bit more sluggish and a bit more bland. Also the Fusion handles more like a Japanese car while the Contour felt more like a European car.As long as I am chiming in, I also think the 90-93 Accord was a high point for Honda, and I think the next generation (94-96 or 7?) was the low point. I can definitely see Saturn L300 in the front end of the spy shots for '08, and 5-series in the huge flanks. Not a bad thing necessarily, just noted. "

Actually the 2007 Mazda6 has had the same $2000 rebate since about November, so few would have sold for much more than invoice minus that $2000. Prices seem to have gone as much as $1500 to $2500 lower...but I don't think everyone is getting a price this low. So I think there is a much smaller differential than 3-4 grand...more like a $2000ish range for most. Just a few posts back Accords were found to be going for discounts of $3500 or even more...which is $1500 or more below invoice. Why is this not also an issue for the Accord buyer?

What Honda has to do to sell Acuras OTH has very little relevance to Accords, there is a whole lot more profit in the upper tier brands. In any case, it should be noted however, that it is possible to buy an Accord for some number slightly below invoice, an unusual occurence to be sure and something that will not likely be possible when the 08s get here.

I'd be willing to believe $4,000 below sticker. Accords are selling for that today, at my local Honda dealer (and yours too, probably).$4,000 below invoice would put an Accord EX V6 at something like $21,000, or below the sticker of an Accord with drum brakes and hubcaps. You may have seen what you say you saw (you see?  sorry for the alliteration) but I can't honestly wrap my mind around an Accord for about $12,000, which is what a Value Package Accord would be with $4,000 below invoice. That would be cheaper than the Fit without cruise control, and $3,000 below the price of a Civic without a radio or A/C. I really think you believe what you are saying, but with all due respect, I don't believe at any point in the last 10 years you could buy an Accord for $12,000/$4,000 under invoice. "

I just may encourage her to consider a new mazda6 rather than spending $4-5K on a junk-mobile...$14K for a nice new car like the Mazda6 SVE is a fantastic bargain, IMO. I really agree with your logic. $4,000 would buy a high-mileage 10 year old Honda (that's a lot of money for a car with 150,000 miles). My car is worth $3,600 or so ""According""  to Kelley Blue Book (1996 Accord LX Auto, 4-cyl, 173,000 miles). This week, the radiator went out, something that cost more than $500. These types of repairs/replacements are bound to happen on cars of this age/mileage, so buying a reliable $14k car is probably at least as financially sound as buying a $4,000 car that will need some repairs sooner than later.

Well look at the math. Let's say it costs 11k per accord and the median profit per car is 7k. Let's use 300k Accords sold in the US per year, that's 2.1 billion in profit. Assume they broke even on the other 700k cars sold in the US (which I highly doubt), yet that 2.1 billion is 3 times greater than their posted global profit of 609 million last year. Hmmmm.... "

Sounds about right to me. Of course, shipping(they eat a chunk of it to keep their shipping in line with the domestics) and prep and such eats into it, and the warranty coverage and so on, so figure $11K on that VP plus 3-4K in overhead. I've seen the VP going for $15K at the end of the year, so that's probably their real bottom line(and trust me - a VP - the guys will take ANY offer on it since it's a lot anchor in most major cities.Oh - and ~30% of the VPs are made in Japan. If you can get one made there instead of the U.S., it's a slightly better car in terms of fit and finish. Or go U.S. - it's a nice car if you get it in a dark color so the non-body colored accents don't immediately make it obvious.Oh - one last thing - the steel wheels on the Civic and Accords weigh exactly the same as the alloys. You're paying purely for bling with factory alloys, so if you want to really save weight, go aftermarket. "

gotta go with accordman on this one - what I saw listed for Hondas had to do with the Ridgeline truck and the S2000 only and weren't rebates at all - instead mfgr. to dealer incentives. If you go back and read the older posts you'll note that I did say the $3000-$4000 I saw for the Accord last year was ""marketing support"" or ""dealer cash"". Again, it could have been a regional thing so maybe a lot of you didn't see it. I did not look at other zips across the country to see if it was a National thing either. I was shopping for a car last summer and did see it. I was only looking at a V6 too so that may play into it somewhat but I don't think they change the amount based on the trim level.I'm only seeing $750 in dealer cash right now but the summer has just begun.In my experience when you see vehicles selling for thousands less than the sticker price then the mfr is kicking some money into the dealer pot in some way. Especially for a Honda. We've only owned one but I've dealt with Honda salesmen on 3 different occasions. Getting them to budge on price is no minor feat. YMMV. "

well it may be 2.1 billion of profit if you only consider manufacturing cost. There is much much more cost associated with running any sort of business - including administration (the suits), paying their utility bills, taxes, health care/pension programs etc. etc. etc. Does it take a great big chunk out of your 2.1 billion, sure seems to doesn't it? Hmmmmm, but understand what I was talking about, the actual direct cost of manufacturing (materials and labor) an automobile (this being an estimate) - NOT the total cost including any overhead. This all in response to a poster that seems to think that there is so much NET profit in an automobile that a 'good deal' can't be had unless some manufacturer is dropping his drawers with some outrageous rebate and/or financing programs. These kind of expectations are really a 'Detroit' car phenomena and will continue to haunt those mfgrs for years to come (when you shop the Camcord, for example, you expect to negotiate from MSRP, do the same thing with a Fusibu then you expect (and generally receive) discounts to some number well below invoice. And then they wonder why they continue to lose their arss in the car business and further have suspect resale values! Give me a break - but it does lend some truth to the adages that 'you get what you (are willing) to pay for' and 'cheap ain't (necessarily) good'. "

I agree with what you say from a good accountant's perspective, cost of materials are generally an easy number to glean off a financial statement, labor costs (and the assocaited costs that go with that) a little tougher to segregate which of those costs were actually incurred directly from production. What is acutally contained in COGS (cost of goods sold) is somewhat variable within established accounting principles and techiques. However, I think the general reaction to Honda if they do only spend 11k (and I think it may easily be somewhat less than that) making a car that they sell for 20k, will be more like zzzom6's - they somehow think they are getting ripped off something that is not the case at all. Not good PR for Honda or any manfacturer for the public to understand the economics of a durable goods manufacturing operation IMO. "

I chose a Taurus once and that turned into a costly mistake. Now I choose to buy Hondas.An interesting quote. We must be outside of the norm because neither my wife or I have ever owned a Honda or a Toyota. We have, however, owned two Mazdas, a new 1977 GLC (puddle jumper) bought new and a 2000 Miata convertible bought new. Both were fine cars but we bought a 2007 SEL AWD Fusion this time, $27,105 MSRP.That decision was based on several factors. We really liked the styling, inside and out. We have generally had good luck with Ford products. The professional reviews of the Fusion have been good. We considered the Accord and Camry to be out of our price range. The Asian cars also strike us as having ""plain Jane"" styling. There is a certain ""sameness"" to them all.But what I am curious about goes to the quote. Your bad experience with a Taurus drove you to Honda. While Honda and Toyota build some fine cars -- that is a given -- it is still possible to get one that is troublesome.Would a bad experience with a Honda drive you (or anyone) toward something from the ""Big 3"" or would you (they) still stick with Honda? How deep does brand loyalty go?We own two other Fords, a 1997 Thunderbird with 86,000 miles on it and a 2000 Focus station wagon with 92,000 miles on it. Neither has been trouble free but neither has had a major problem either (knock on wood).It will be interesting to see if our Fusion lives up to its reliability billing and/or equals our other two Ford products in that area. Right now, according to published reports, the Fusion is earning a high ""conquest"" rating. Buyers are trading in makes other than Fords at a significant rate.These ""converts"" tell me that Ford is doing something right with the Fusion. I hope it continues. If the Fusion continues to equal or better the reliability rating of Accord and Camry we will be happy campers. "

I think basic reliable recent used car transportation is about 7-8k...I think starting out in life with no car payment helps a lot. Yes, but 7-8K or even 3-5 is not going to equal no car payment for many (such as my daughter) just starting out. She did get a one time freebie, but she has pretty well worn it out. Partly this is because she drove more than I had expected she would, it was at about 100K when she got it and I had anticipated it would be at maybe 120K by the time she was done with college and would still have maybe a year or two of life left in it. I'm really not sure how she managed to get 10K miles per year on it.By coicidence, the one expensive repair she had was also a $500 radiator at Ford dealer. She happened to be out of town when it happened so we had her get a tow to nearest Ford dealer...not knowing where else to go, plus I was figuring the car had overheated and was going to be dead anyway. Later, I found out this would have been maybe a $300 job at a radiator shop. "

I'm sure the one team that designed the Accord was more cost effective than three teams designing the Aura, G6, and Malibu.

just a suggestion depending on what value you put on engine/drivetrain refinement - stick with the XR variant with the 3.6 in it - but drive it first and make sure that you accelerate it hard coming out of a corner on a test drive. Do yourself a favor, though, and test the new Altima as well. The Aura impressed me as well, and certainly may be 'Detroit's' best effort to date. Or you can wait for the 08 Malibu to get onto the lots, same car slightly different styling cues. The Camry V6, IMO, is easily the best V6 out there right now, likely will get you better FE and may not actually cost any more to own than a Saturn or Malibu. The longer you plan to keep the car, the cheaper things like the Saturn/Malibu become. I would be curious what sort of prices you are being quoted on both cars? "

I guess the closest thing to the 60,000 miles evaluation is Consumer Reports reliability findings. The book on the Fusion is still out, of course, but the preliminary feedback on the 2006 model has been pretty good.I was really interested in the Accord but the wife wasn't, so you know how that goes. Plus we considered the Accord to be out of our price range when equipped like our 2007 AWD SEL Fusion, MSRP $27,105.The other factors were the Fusion's bold styling and excellent handling abilities. We didn't even pursue, test drive or price the Accord but probably should have, in retrospect.Actually, I like the looks of the 2007 Accord better than I do spy the photos I've seen of the 2008 Accord.My only serious complaint about the V6 AWD Fusion is its very poor in-city gas mileage, 14.8 mpg and holding at 3,200 miles. It does deliver 24 mpg in highway driving though. Unfortunately, 95 percent of our driving is in the city, stop and go, short hops. Perhaps a V6 Accord wouldn't do any better. We should have bought an I4 to begin with given that gasoline is at $3 a gallon and headed for $4.So far, the Fusion has been absolutely trouble free for the first six months with nary a single rattle, squeak or flaw to be found. The fit and finish on all of its collective parts are perfect. It's an exceptional automobile -- for us at least. "

I'm in the market for a sporty 4door w/ manual transmission; today i went to the [subaru] dealer and sat in the legacy for the first time. I was pretty shocked to find how cramped the rear quarters were ... And the sad part is im not even a big person. 6'-0"" @ 190lb, i'd consider myself averaged size and I could barely fit in the rear seat. I can get comfortable in the drivers seat ... i just have to put the seat all the way back and recline the seat-back a bit. When i did that, I dont see how anyone could sit behind me. Also, there is some serious lack of headroom [in the back] too, that C-Pillar makes rear-quarters entry an acrobatic task.I wish car companies would make usable rear seats that aren't penalty boxes. In comparison, I drive a '98 regal, and I can fit ok in the rear seat after I positioned the driver seat to my liking.Anybody got good recomendations for a sporty 4door with M/T? I hear the altima's M/T isnt so great and I hate how everyone and their mother's have that car ... too many out there. "

Sporty 4 door with manual... I suggest something a few years old - mainly because for the price of a basic small car, you can easily get something decent and useable.A few year old CTS comes to mind, for instance, as do the previous generation Saabs, and of course the Volvo S60. The rear seats are decently sized AND they are considerably nicer handling than any of the budget boxes. Plus, they often come with all the goodies of a upper-end vehicle. "

At 16k the Accord VP is an excellent value, at 18k for basically the same car, you are getting pretty close to a Mazda V6/stick in terms of TMV. According to Edmunds for the Accord the LX trim adds power mirrors, an upgraded audio system and a few extra interior features. The SE is similar to the LX but has 16-inch alloy wheels (17s for V6-equipped SE models), rear disc brakes, a six-disc in-dash CD changer and steering wheel-mounted audio controls.The Accord SE is pretty comparable to the Mazda6 SVE in equipment level. However the Mazda6 SVE can likely be bought for $1000-2000 less than even the Accord VP, based on the $16k figure being given for the manual transmission Accord VP. "

If he isn't driving in much traffic, a manual is a great choice, IMHO. It adds a level of excitement to a relatively ""boring"" class of cars. My next car will be a manual sedan, as is my current vehicle, as I will need 4 doors for the family but enjoy shifting as well. My commute is 95% highway with no traffic, so obviously I have a different opinion than one who sits in rush hour traffic. As far as resale, I personally am of the opinion that those who purchase cars with manual transmissions, especially midsize sedans, tend to drive their cars to the point where resale value is really a moot point. I feel that those who purchase manuals have more involved/emotional attachments to their cars. "

Some people just like to shift themselves. I'm one of them, but we are few and far between.One of the main reasons for getting a stick in the past, slightly better gas mileage, is pretty much moot now. With auto trannies having 5, 6, or even 7 gears now fuel mileage differences are almost gone and in some cases have swung the other way around. I for one love driving a stick in anything but a truck. The extra control in the snow is another reason for my choice. "

I agree with the positive manual comments. I love driving a manual in heavy traffic too.Just because someone needs four doors, doesn't mean he or she doesn't want the fun and reliability of a manual. The advantages for me are:- better overall mileage- lasts longer than an automatic (fewer repairs)- cheaper initial cost (automatics are usually a more expensive option)- more control- quicker and more responsive- waaaay more fun to driveAgain, these are advantages for ME. I realized that I'm in a minority, especially since many seem to have problems driving a manual in heavy traffic... I find it to be a distinct advantage. And the Accord manual is sooo smooth.  "

The point about resale value only holds if it is a basic car. A manual tansmission BMW, Mercedes, or even a Celica... They sell immediately and for more money.When a stickshift C class comes on the lot - the local dealership put an ad online and it's gone in three days or less every time. There's a very dedicated and small group that specifically seeks out these cars.Plus, yes, shifting is more fun, even in traffic. I can move a car with a good gearbox in and out of city traffic seconds quicker per ""move"" that I make if I want to. Automatics stink at the 10-20mph difference quick bursts that you need to zig and zag through traffic. By the time a typical torque converter unlocks itself and the thing decides to shift, I'm already in that spot. "

So I have to wait until the 08 production ramps up. From what the salesperson said, GT's are prioritized last. Right now you can find lowlevel trim legacy's.. next on the list is the new 3.0L model due like mid-late june. The other car I have in mind is the Mazdaspeed3.

That's mostly because there are no manuals being *offered*. The number of people desiring a manual has hardly changed in the last 30 or 40 years. A good indication of this is the number of manu-matics that are everywhere. If the pent up demand for shifting manually wasn't there, Porsche would have remained the only company doing it.I find it to be no problem in daily traffic - and I live in Los Angeles, birthplace of the freeway and traffic jam.For me, it's mostly cost and reliability. If I need a new clutch, I can budget for one and squeeze it into my budget. If I need a rebuild on an automatic... I've had cars sit for as long as three months as I tried to scrape together the money.(read: take the bus, which in L.A. is not fun at all - or safe)But it's also fun at times - traffic is okay - it is what it is.

Maybe, but diesel's are a pain in the neck. I owned a golf diesel 10 years ago. They do last forever (mine was running perfect at 400k), and get tremendous millage (I was getting 60) but they can be a nightmare in the cold. below 20 degrees, diesel fuel turns into something resembling jello. You have to be careful to buy winterized diesel, or, or properly do it yourself. You also need to make sure your battery is in top shape, the same with the glow plugs. A gas car can start with a weak battery, a diesel won't. In extreme cold (about 10 degrees or lower) you really need to plug it in at night. There's issues with supply (most gas stations don't have diesel pumps), more maintainance, and repairs are usually much more expensive. Just finding a good diesel mechanic can be a challenge. A diesel motor is also a good bit more expensive than a traditional gasoline engine. And, without a turbo charger, your going to notice a considerable loss of power. A lot more torque, but less horse power. "

I just got a used 2000 Mazda 626 w/ 118,000 miles. I've had it for 2 days and now it won't go into reverse. It shifts fine when you're driving but what would cause it to not go into reverse?Sounds like a linkage problem. Why would you buy a car that had no reverse? Did reverse work when you bought it? I'd take it to a Mazda dealer. "

Since both the Optima and Aura beat out the 2007 Camry in C/D's latest comparo of family sedans, I think there is an excellent chance that the Fusion would beat the new Camry if C/D did that comparo. The Camry finished next to last, only ahead of the woeful Sebring, in that comparo. "

I'd agree that the Fusion would probably beat the 07 Camry in a comparison test if the vehicles are I4 models, but I wouldn't be so sure of it if the Fusion V6 was compared against a Camry V6 today. I think the ratings would change a bit. I could be wrong but I doubt it. Other than subjective styling differences, lower prcing and handling, the Camry V6 (especially XLE and SE models) offer more in the way of standard equipment and safety features than the Fusion does.

Yes, if C/D compared the Camry SE V6 to the Fusion V6, the Camry might take it. The old Camry V6 was only six points (I think) behind the Fusion in the tests of '06 models.

This time I went to the Mazda dealer to check out the MS6. I sat inside and i was impressed. Fit and finish are really nice. I didnt take a test drive, but I plan on it. I heard alot of comments about how the shifter is no good, but when i was rowing through the gears the gates were very well defined and extremely easy to find w/ short throws, i dont know what will change when I actually drive it. However, the clutch is VERY stiff ... Not sure if i could live w/ that. One problem i do have [not with this vehicle] is finding reverse on a 6speed transmissions [either left-up or down-right]. I can get can get the forward gears easy of course, but it seems like the shifter wont move farther left[MS6 has reverse up and to left]. Do I need to have the car running and/or have my foot on the brake and ONLY THEN will reverse open up? Only manuals i have driven are when reverse is behind 5th gear [5speeds]. If someone could enlighten me, i would be extremely grateful.I did the rear seat check and it passed w/ flying colors, a 6'-0"" individual can easily sit behind a driver of equal or less height.Hopefully there are no glarring errors or hidden problems w/ this car. Ive read about the computer fix that reduces the cars power or something, not sure. Hopefully it isnt major. I am also unsure of Mazda's reliability but im sure its probably solid since its an asian manufacturer. Overall its one of those cars that is under the radar. Does anyone have any real-world 0-60 or 0-100 times? As in, w/o doing a insane 4000rpm clutch dump. Those advertised times are nice, but can only be achieved when one abuses the clutch. "

I have driven this car a few times, it is my ""stretch target."" Alas my price range relegates me to the more mundane boring stuff but I loved the shifter, I thought it was very precise. I recall to get reverse you push down on the shifter while moving up and to the left ala VW. The Contour had a collar you would pull up when shifting into reverse, but the MS6 isn't an MTX75 trans.Mazda has had some issues with reliability in certain models (the 626 4 cyl w/auto, early RX8, prev gen RX7 - which use rotary engines, not like the regular inline 4s) but has a pretty stellar reputation overall (Miatas last forever, etc).I really wouldn't be too worried about a turbo motor. Mazda, Mitsubishi, Saab, Volvo and Honda all have turbo motors that are well proven and the motors seem to have excellent longevity, especially in stock form.The nice thing about turbos is they offer excellent efficiency while below boost.

Perna, you're making me reminisce on my '02 Maxima (RIP). That car had some great pick up.I got to drive a Mazda6 rental car a couple of weeks ago. I have to say I was pretty impressed with the way the car handled. It was a 4-cylinder, so not always real powerful,but zippy enough. When my brother would come to town when I had the Maxima, he always liked to drive it whenever we would go out on the town, and he would punch that accelerator and make our heads kind of snap back in the seat and he'd get this look of ""wonder"" on his face.Unfortunately, he tries to do the same thing with my '07 Lexus RX.

""reasons they've never caught on big in the states"" Yes they never did catch on big but rather than maintenance/repair costs the real reason was and still is cheap gasoline. Yeah, yeah it is over $3.00 per in most of the country but nowhere near the cost of gas in Europe. Diesel fuel, while still expensive is significantly cheaper there. And lets not forget some of the other reasons. Americans have long memories and many remember the GM diesel fiasco in the 80's which unfortunately turned many against any sort of a diesel. Then there is the lack of availability for almost any diesel (other than commercial trucks and light trucks) car or SUV even though they are fabulous economy wise. Also, even those who had taken a chance (owned or drove) on a diesel 20+ years ago have no idea how technology has improved them. A modern direct injection turbo diesel is quiet..quick...economical..and long lived. It does not smoke...smell..rattle excessively at idle nor is it a slug. In short, nearly no one in this country knows just how good they really are. The fuel was only recently formulated for low sulfur content (important for emissions) and only recently have workable ""traps"" for particulates been introduced. Mercedes, I believe, can now pass EPA standards. So, I too would rather have a modern diesel than a hybrid that may never give ""pay back"" for the large up front cost premium. This isn't even taking into account the largely unknown long term reliability of battery packs etc. However, these seem fairly reliable at this point. If Honda's diesel becomes accepted (and it should) there could be a flood of diesel cars in this country, it is about time. Past time really. "

two things-1) the thing that the Camry has always been and what is largely responsible for its success is that they are normally 'softer', something not high on an enthusiast mags priorities but well up there with the average American carbuyer in this class, and 2) C/Ds COTY award has as much to do with a car's 'significance' as it does with any evaluation of a particular car's dynamic capabilities.

I bought an '04 NB 5 Spd GL TDI brand new in May, '04, when I was still making a 28 mile round trip up and down the North Dallas Tollway everyday. It broke in perfectly, only used 1/2 litre of the expensive 505.01 Castrol oil in the first 5,000 miles. Never got below 40 MPG in town even when new, and always averaged 45-47 over a tankfull. All its power was at the top of the pedal--going along at 65 in 5th, just had to think about it and I was around the next car. It did have an EGR cooler recall at 15,000 miles, then warranty replaced my tandem pump assembly at 16,000 miles. Within six months of purchase, the traditionally less-expensive than all other grades of gas diesel fuel completely traded places, remaining at or above the most expensive premium. In mid-05, I moved back to Waco and retired at end of '05--driving much less. Reading about some of the diesel's characteristics on another website made me kind of nervous, especially in regards to the turbo going to pieces and such--also the only VW dealership being 30 miles away. When I read of the newly designed Altima with the CVT, I had to drive one and was instantly sold on it--also was getting tired of having to shift all the time. Got 80% of what I paid for the VW three years earlier after putting 18,500 miles on it. Got the Altima on 12/21/06, has 2,600 miles on it now. Within a short time, ALL gasoline grades had once again reverted back to being higher than any diesel, but I'm not sorry. One nice side-effect was, I discovered that I'd been hoodwinked into buying an extended warranty on the VW--told it was only $106, which seemed reasonable. Got a check for $806 two months after cancelling the VW warranty--had two amounts on the Advice of Remittance attachment, one for $106.01, then another for $699.99. They got me into it with the low price, then wrapped the remainder into my balance without me ever knowing it--that'll help pay for some of the lower mileage on the Altima... "

In the meantime, I bought a '67 GTO convertible with 57,000 miles on it from the original owner which I'd been trying to buy since 1976. This happened two weeks before the Cutlass was supposed to arrive--told the dealer and he said no problem, even gave me back my $100 deposit when I said he could keep it--they could sell all the diesels they could build then.

Grad, this is the entire paragraph from Edmunds own V6 comparison test (Fusion 4th place). ""All who drove the Fusion remarked that it felt the most ""European"" of the four. With its taut chassis, confident steering and predictable handling, the Fusion exhibited a sophisticated-sporty nature that even the best handler of the group, the Honda Accord, lacked. In this regard, the Fusion excels in our group, but like a BMW, the trade-off is that this attribute takes it further away from what some might call a luxurious ride. Not many carmakers are ever successful in achieving both sporty and luxurious, but Ford has found a reasonable compromise in the Fusion. We doubt anybody would say the Fusion rides too harshly."" "

I took the Mazdaspeed6 for a test drive about a month ago and I thought it was great. Although my v-6 version is pretty fast and a touch lighter than the MS6, the higher torque and AWD was great coming out of corners. All the versions of the Mazda6 corner much flatter than all the cars I've driven in this class, so if you like twisties, this would be easily the best car in this class. I did like the steering character of the Legacy...more so than the Accord. It just felt more immediate and more connected. And like my previous Legacy, I found the AWD was great in cornering and managing quick starts without wheel spin. But the brakes on both the accord and legacy were wanting compared to the 6. I think most tests have both of these cars stopping 10-15 feet longer than the mazda6 and I think the mazdaspeed has better brakes than the v-6 too. The things the Accord has going for it, IMO, is the quality of the interior and their best-in-class manual tranny. The Mazda clutch is a bit stiff and engages quickly, but nothing you can't get used to once you start to get the timing right. So would you ever consider a coupe? The 08 Accord coupe looks pretty good (much better than the sedan both current and future) and from what I've heard should be a bit more sporty than the current version. Problem will be the premium you'd have to pay if you were to buy within the first 6 months of release. And after having a coupe before (an accord) and dealing with the inconveniences, I would have a hard time going back to one unless it was a second car.From a value perspective, the current mazda6 is hard to beat either in v-6 form or direct injected turbo4 if you value handling. And if you want/need extra hauling capacity, the v-6 has a hatchback and wagon option. "

the 3.0-liter Ford V6 is definitely competitive though not at the top of the mountain.certainly an opinion but something also substantiated by 'full throttle' noise levels (dbs) which is higher (by a significant amount) in the DT (77 or 78db, if I recall correctly) than anything else in this class. And before you look up another V6 that tests out at say 75 and you think 'competitive though not at the top of the mountain' do some research on the decibel scale. And then, once you get past the noise levels then you can compare the whole concept of a smooth vibration-free engine at higher rpms - something I've never seen an objective measure for, but also something easily experienced in a test drive or two. There is a lot more to an engine than simply HP figures even though the DT is deficient in that dept. as well. Not at the top of the mountain, positively - not even on an upslope probably.IMO the Toyota 2GR is easily the most refined and advanced engine in this group, although those entrants from Nissan, Honda, GM, and even Hyundai (probably in that order) come much closer. To many of us, what's 'under the hood' makes or breaks a car - and given that bias, any car with the DT V6 is broken. Haven't had a chance to interview the 3.5 yet and it sounds like the 'new and improved' DT 3.0 is still a coupla years away. The inability of that particular mfgr to produce a truly competitive smaller engine may yet be the death of them.  "

All this talk about ""best handler"" leads me to ask, is the Accord the best handler (in C/D's view) of the cars they recently compared to the Accord, or of all family sedans?I ask this because... what about the Mazda6? It is an exceptional handler for a family sedan. It's also IMO perhaps the best-looking of the current family sedans, even though the design is nearly five years old. And it's a terrific value right now, especially the Special Value Edition that starts at about $20k MSRP, but can be had in my town with no haggling for $16,500 (so it might be had for even less with some negotiating). It is comparable in equipment to the Sonata SE I4, with 17"" alloys, ground effects, blacked-out lamps, power seat, leather wheel/shifter, CD changer, and a sport cloth interior. About the only major thing it doesn't have that the Sonata does is ESC. But you get best in class (?) handling, a nicely-styled interior with quality materials, and a sporty exterior (at least for a family car). If I were buying a car right now, it would be on my list (especially with my Ford supplier discount and a $500-off-best-offer coupon I have for a local dealer). "

well, of course, things like better insulation and engine isolation can make a difference in loudness and vibration. Given that and from your comments, I guess your contention must be then that Ford, for some reason, does a poorer job in this and therefore the DT is really every bit as smooth and quiet as what's in some of these other cars? Horse puckey! Decibels are a measure of sound energy and increase logarithimically with value but is the only measure I've ever seen of how loud any car actually is. As I said earlier, a test drive by almost anybody will certainly confirm the whole refinement issue, or if you don't choose to believe that, about any comparison/road test of any Ford vehicle (3.0 DT equipped) will usually make the same comments.And lest you Ford guys think this is all about 'bashing', you shouldn't take it as such, the engine issues are a simple comment that does have some historical and current basis in fact and a commentary on that particular manufacturer's continued problems building a better car. Fix the engine and fix the car, IMO, everybody is better off (including this country's (and Mexico's) economy and the carbuyer benefits from having yet another good choice. Or put another way, put the Hyundai 3.3 liter in the Fusion and then you Fusionados/6ixers would really have something to talk about! "

There is no way he's getting 275 hp, but saying that an intake and exhaust won't give you performance gains is simply wrong. In fact, that will give you more power by itself than you can get from a re-flash or chip upgrade. And there's no reason why adding a true dual exhaust (if true) would impact emissions.After all an engine is just an air pump and the more air you can get in and out the more power you can make. I figure the dual exhaust and intake are worth 20 hp, tops with the chip/reflash adding another 10-15 max (and probably requiring premium fuel). "

but saying that an intake and exhaust won't give you performance gains is simply wrong. In fact, that will give you more power by itself than you can get from a re-flash or chip upgrade.I am not saying there are no gains there, I am saying there is more noise than power. Also, you need to look at the existing system, if you were replacing a straw with a sewer pipe, that might be something, but its not like the system isn't relatively free flowing in factory trim.I think you would have to have a pretty crummy exhaust to get 20 hp out of replacing it and if the intake is a ram air, it only works when you are forcing air through it at a high enough velocity, and if it is a cone filter, its not really buying you anything but noise.Chips can bump ignition (or valve timing) timing and re-tune fuel maps to provide better performance at the expense of fuel economy and emissions. I agree that it probably requires premium fuel. Chips aren't as helpful as stand alone items, they are more to tune the car to other mods.And there's no reason why adding a true dual exhaust (if true) would impact emissions. It depends where you are located, if you are in a CARB state you must have an exemption sticker stating that the component is certified as a factory replacement part. In theory, this is an EPA requirement everywhere, its just CARB states that police it. I guess its possible that he could have true dual manifold back exhausts with each exhaust having a second cat, but I doubt it. "

Factory intake and exhaust systems are tuned for less noise and lower cost. Adding a cold air intake and a true dual exhaust can significantly increase the airflow into and out of the engine and if you understand anything about internal combustion engines you know that's the secret to more power. A cold air intake alone can easily add 10 hp. And production vehicles routinely add 5 hp with dual exhausts. So 20 hp from that setup is more than reasonable.I'm not advocating the changes that were made or the 275 hp claim. I'm only disputing some of your claims to the contrary. "

If you are letting in more air (cold air intake), you are letting in more dirt also (tests have been done to prove this). If the exhaust is less restrictive, you may gain (very little) hp, but you will loose torque at the same rate (back pressure is needed for torque). The only way a ""chip"" will do any good at all, is if the engine computer was severely de-tuned in the first place, and then you are probably killing your gas mileage.

Actually both perform just fine going by the numbers and I think the handling issue goes back to which feels better to the driver. The motor trend comparison that was linked says this about that for the Fusion:If 90 percent of what matters about a car to you is how it feels in your hands, the V-6 SEL version of this Mazda6-derived sedan could be your prize.OTOH, MT has this to say about Accord's handling:Behind the wheel, the Accord is nimble, but not devoid of awkwardness.

Your telling me by opening up the intake and the exhaust this doesn't give more HP????Hmm perhaps my engineering degree helped critical analytical skills. I never said that opening up the intake and exhaust wouldn't give more HP as a general rule. I was implying that the vehicle was already designed well enough (something I assumed you would agree with, given your cheerleading) that even if you cut off the exhaust entirely, you wouldn't see that much of a performance gain. The same goes for the intake. I am a pretty big fan of modifications too and for certain vehicles it helps more than others (mainly boosted cars), but I don't know about 55 hp on a 3.0l Duratec.[Edit] reflecting some more, perhaps that is why he needed the chip, so that he could get rid of the rev limiter because his mods shifted the power curve above the fuel cut for the motor. Moving the redline another grand or so might get it there.By using performance wheels/tires this lightens the car, it doesn't add weight?? what are you talking about? Its not the concept of tires and wheels that I have an issue with, its wheels that are heavier than stock (I would like to see him weigh the 18"" bling bling wheels next to the 17"" stockers and see what is heavier, and then do the same for the tires. Replacing the 17"" stock wheels with BBS 17"" (17 lbs/wheel, thats pretty light, the 18"" were 23 lbs/wheel) or something that is even lighter would help, and going with a low profile R-compound performance tire would provide astounding performance while reducing weight.Rotating mass is considerably worse than dead weight elsewhere on the vehicle, and also increases unsprung weight (weight not controlled by they suspension, south of the shocks/springs, as it were) which is detrimental to handling. A 14"" Miata alloy wheel weighs 11 lbs, just food for thought. "

Wrong.

More efficient can (and does) lead to better fuel economy. It may not be the same for all cars, but for both the 4-cyl and V6 in the Mazda6, not only is it possible, but it happens as well.Hence the reason a lot of turbos tank in the fuel economy department.The BMW 335i has got a turbocharged V6 that puts out well over the advertised 300 HP (V8 territory) and I've seen fuel economy reports as high as 27 MPG on the highway.

Yours, I would rather take Edmunds word on it, thanks anyway. But the fact remains that my V6 Accord will go around a corner as fast, or faster than the V6 Fusion. I don't spend my entire day seeing how fast my car will go around each corner though, so I would like a nice ride too. Which is another thing the Accord is better at. glad you like my word choice. unfortunately, you didn't seem to understand that i am not trying to impose my opinion on anyone. just pointing out that because one magazine says its a better handler doesn't make it THE better handler. handling is subjective. you may think the accord handles better, and someone else may think the fusion does, or the altima does, or the camry does. it doesn't make them wrong and you right.that's the part you need to understand. there are lots of great cars out there that are better than the accord for some people. the accord is not for everyone...it's certainly not for me.-thene "

I don't believe it period. You cannot shove more air, burn more fuel for more hp and claim better gas mileage.Believe it. It's been proven time and time again. We're not talking about forced induction, just allowing the engine to breathe better with cooler air. The engine runs more efficiently and produces more power which means (under NORMAL driving) you can use less throttle. One of the universal truths is that a dirty air filter kills your mpg and replacing it with a clean one improves mpg. This just takes that theory one step further. "

One of the universal truths is that a dirty air filter kills your mpg and replacing it with a clean one improves mpg. This just takes that theory one step further. Yes, but you are likely getting less filtering and letting more dirt into the engine...is this a good thing? Generally, the less restrictive the filter is the less filtering it is doing. A dirty filter reduces air flow, but actually filters better. You could let more air in by having no filter at all, too...do you want to do that to get more HP and better MPG, its just going one step further from the after market, less restrictive filters  . "

Most air intakes (stock or otherwise) have some type of swirl inducer or something to create more turbulent airflow going into the motor. Apparently, more turbulent airflow has more exposed area for the fuel to bond with so you get better ""atomization"" (I think thats the term) for a better, leaner burn for more power with better MPG and still not killing emissions too much.

this is almost exactly my experience with the same engine in my bigger/heavier Avalon - and sure 'buzzing around town' I will usually see in the low 20s. To contend that a Camry (any other V6 engined car in this group including the Fusion) can't get 30mpg is ludricrous, and pointing to the results of the new EPA testing procedures equally so. All cars will lose a coupla mpg or so with the new tests, especially those V8s and/or artifically aspirated engines.

Mazda could do a CAI if they weren't as worried about the sound or water intrusion. They didn't want to warranty a bunch of hydrolocked motors or hear people whining its too loud, so they didn't. As I mentioned, I'm okay with the noise and don't usually drive through lakes so I would be okay with the downsides associated with a CAI. Joe Camry probably wouldn't be.I personally think the Accord rides too soft, while other people on this forum think its too firm. Aftermarket shocks would firm up the ride considerably, as would sport springs. Honda doesn't want to upset Grandma Accord's tender bottom so they make it a bit on the soft side.It's not a matter of improving on a manufacturing design as much as optimizing a design to meet the individual's needs.

A few extra hp for a midsize family sedan isn't usually worth the extra cost of a cold air intake. If they're only selling 100K vehicles and the cold air intake costs $50 more than a paper filter and plastic intake that's $5M in savings right there. If the cost is higher or the volume is higher then the savings would be even higher.Noise is also a much bigger design issue than you might think.

The real reason they restrict the engines is to be found on of all things, motorcycles. A restricted car that's severely choked-off creates a lot less NOX emissions since there's less oxygen in the equation. They do this with bikes all the time to get them to pass the new smog laws.And what's the first thing a bike owner does? Replace the stock exhaust and filter. re-jet the carbs to run for maximum power as opposed to lowest pollution.(or in a FI system, re-chip it)It makes an enormous difference in higher compression engines, which tend to be the most restricted from the factory. Of course, they are right - a K&N filter was made for racing off-road, where a completely clogged with dust filter will blow up your engine. So there is a bit more wear and as a result, you'll need to change your oil every 2000 miles. "

The fact that you believed this guy when he said he had 275hp, and then posted it on this forum, That's funny. It does not matter what the make (Honda, Toyota, Ford, Chevy,) these modifications you mentioned (intake, exhaust, chip) will get you at most 20hp. A far cry from 54hp.

Fast and cheap = not reliable (NOS).It depends how much you want to increase power and what sacrifices to drivability you are willing to make. A 50-shot of NOS isn't going to affect very much, but a 100-shot or more might start to get dangerous. You could probably run 5-7 psi on a turbo without and intercooler and with relatively poor fuel management, but if you want to run 16 or 17 or more, you should have all your ducks in a row. Hondas can also look at aftermarket vtec controllers, which seem to do more to move the powerband rather than raise it altogether.Just swapping out intake/exhaust/chip isn't going to get you too much power but isn't really going to affect the longevity of anything either. All of my cars have had K&N filters because I like that you clean and re-use them as opposed to throwing them away. I have never had an internal engine problem based on close to 1,000,000 miles over 5 cars that have used these filters. Two cars have also had CAIs with no ill effects excepting the attention of the local constable.What I think is funny is that a couple hundred dollar investment in HPDEs or autocrosses would do more to make someone a better, faster driver than a few grand in bolt ons.

The most effective CAIs (letting in more air, without letting in more dirt) are the foam type, that you have to clean, then re-oil. Not many people are willing to do this for the small (maybe 5 hp) gain. Not to mention the prices of some CAIs is crazy. Then there is always the chance of going through one deep puddle of water, and screwing your engine up. Not worth it, to me anyway. "

The real reason that they restrict them is because it makes them PASS EMISSIONS. No other reason. It kills low-end power and the car is barely running at idle when it pollutes the most. It also hurts emissions a bit as well, but there's just no other way to get a typical small turbo to pass smog other than remapping the ECU and restricting the exhuast and intake.Fixing it - it makes the engine work like the designers wanted. Some guy in Germany who makes the engine designs it and THEN they go ""oh gheez - look at the god-awful smog regulations in California!"" So they tweak the auxiliary components and computers and such to make it work. But it's jsut not the way it came off the designing board.More power, better low-end peroformance, better fuel economy...

If you don't want to accept a sound scientific theory with field test data to back it up that's your prerogative. "

what you are leaving unsaid, (in typical scape fashion) is that under those same circumstances that you can coax 32 mpg out of your Fusion, a Camcordima is going to do a coupla mpg BETTER, cars you earlier claimed couldn't ever/never hit 30 mpg. How do I know this you ask? Owning a couple of of them helps but also because that is what the relative difference is in the EPA hwy ratings - UNLESS, of course, you really want to try to sell the rather preposterous proposition that the EPA itself is also somehow biased specifically against Ford products?

while you won't get a whole lot of argument out of me (I own an Altima 3.5 and previously a coupla Maximas). I am of the opinion, that the design is somehow getting a little long in tooth and the engine isn't currently as smooth and refined as the Toyota 2GR (and yes, I own one of these as well). May have something to do with the C and the i on the Toyota valvetrains and not on the Nissans, I'm not sure. The one thing the 2 year old 2GR doesn't have that the VQ does, however, is a long and proven history. The VQ will be at the top of any list of the best 6 cylinder engines ever built (along with the BMW straight 6s), but I do prefer my 2GR to my wife's VQ - the Toyota engine being smoother, more powerful and more economical - and I too will admit to being Nissan biased  "

not nearly the point because the difference (4 or 5 hp) is minimal. Case in point - the Lexus ES350 rated on premium at 272 HP, the mechanically identical Camry rated at 268 on regular.

Besides if anybody on this forum should understand what these new high tech engines do relative to changes in spark and valve timing relative to detonation, than you would also understand that it really doesn't make any difference except for those few HP.Would suggest to you that most Camry V6 drivers put regular in their cars simply because they can save a few bucks every fillup, don't hear or feel anything different with 'crummy' gas, and then by your assumptions of ignorance must wait until their oil pressure drops to 0 before they ever even open the hood again. :confuse: ""> "

but the larger market for midsize sedans isn't always interested in a throaty intake note. the enthusiasts are which is probably why mazdaspeed makes available a CAI that does not destroy the factory warranty. but Mazda does not want to sell the 6 to enthusiasts only...it is still a midsize sedan after all. most enthusiasts aren't too concerned if a 42"" plasma will fit in the hatchback or even if their car has 4 doors. so if the 6 had a chance of growing market share from the 626, it still had to have some appeal to the larger market of those who were interested in a midsize sedan which probably meant making an attempt at keeping noise levels down (amongst other compromises that they made to make the ride more comfortable). and I'm sure mazda knew those who really were interested in modding their cars would and would be willing to pay extra for it which means more money for mazda by offering their own CAI. and there are some places where you may not want a CAI... for example very rainy areas that are flood prone. one other point... imagine mazda said to customers ""we have a part that costs extra that will slow down your car but will make it a bit quieter at wide open throttle."" that would be a hard sell imo. whereas it would be far more palatable if they were to say ""we have a CAI which adds power and torque while giving it a more throaty intake note."" which would you rather try to sell?

Only cars with higher compression ratios need premium. But, all cars engine's are computer controlled, and the sensors more or less know what type of fuel you're putting in. If the sensors in a high compression engine detect low octane fuel, the computer will just compensate for it by advancing the timing and tweaking a couple other things in the engine.as it was explained to me.It was explained to you incorrectly. The engine doesn't sense the octane level of the fuel. The engine has a knock sensor. Higher compression engines need higher octane fuel that's less likely to pre-ignite or detonate (knock). Using lower octane fuel in an engine designed for higher octane fuel can result in knocking which the engine computer detects and compensates by retarding (not advancing) the timing. Retarding the timing reduces both power and fuel economy. If the engine can't compensate enough by retarding the timing then damage can occur. "

But that's just not true.

Everything I posted is correct. It's not about the fuel itself - it's about how the engine is tuned and the effect that the octane rating has on the combustion process.Forcing the computer to retard the timing to prevent knock will reduce both power and fuel economy. By the same token advancing the timing will increase power and fuel economy because it makes the engine more efficient. That's why reflashing or chipping a car improves power but often requires premium fuel. "

From a Govt Site:E85 is then a blend of denatured ethanol and gasoline, therefore:Denatured Ethanol @ 77,815 btu/gal x 85%=66,143Gasoline @114,132 btu/gal x 15%=17,120E85=83,263 btu/gal114,132-83,263=30,869 difference.27% less energy. But since the typical driver drives the same speed as they are used to, they press harder on the pedal to compensate instead of loafing along at 73% of the HP.Since it takes more gas to make up the energy difference AND the fuel itself has less energy per unit(ie - the injectors don't spray 27% more fuel) - this results in a small factor of magnification of the effect.So the real loss is closer to 35-40% mpg!Too bad E85 doesn't cost 60% what Gasoline does. That's the real rub - it's a hidden way for the oil compnaies to make more money.****http://www.chevron.com/products/prodserv/fuels/bulletin/oxy-fuel/enrgycon.shtmlThis covers oxygenated gas. Why is this important? It's a dirty trick most companies use today. They mix in MBTE because it increases the octane rating. The net effect is that they make 83-85 octane gas and blend in enough EBTE and additives to get it to 87, 91, or 93 octane.So the higher the octane with oxygenated gas, the worse your mileage is! With non-oxygentated gas, it should be the same, but then again, running premioum in a non-premium engine, as the previous poster pointed out above - can also result in lower mileage as most 87 rated engines don't have computers to adjust for better fuel(as opposed to premium engines which always are made to compensate for lower quality fuel)*edit - from the second link above:""But, noted Schiller, only a few vehicles calibrated for regular fuel can advance timing beyond their nominal ideal setting when burning premium. ""***P.S. Oxygenated E85 would yield 30% less energy - a double hit! "

Good analysis. But I draw a different conclusion of who is making the money. It's not Big Oil...it's Big Government, at state and national levels. National gov't takes $.184 per gallon, my state takes $.25 per gallon plus 6.3% of the wholesale price. Whenever the price goes up the state grabs more money without raising the tax RATE. Add in all the different blends/formulations the government requires across the country and factor that into their cost of doing business. Then take all of the corn which will be used to make E85 out of food chain, whether for people or animals, and you'll see nonpetroleum prices increase. How much? I don't recall, but I've read $1 a pound or more for a steak is likely. Here in the great liberal north east we've had MBTE and oxygenated gasoline blends mandated by our governments forced upon us for years. I believe the *$#&@ governments make more per gallon than the oil companies and certainly more that the gas station owner. And the government doesn't do dink, except sit back with their hands out to collect the money from the people who explore, drill, transport, refine, transport again and then run a retail operation to make the product readily available. "

Its not big government thats making money through ethanol, its the farmers. the government gets a fixed amount per gallon. but with more and more of the countries corn crop being diverted to ethanol production, the price of corn has doubled. brace yourself for a big spike in the price of beef and dairy products (cows are fed primarily corn). And we're not going to see the worst of it. A lot of poor countries depend on corn from the US. And less of it will be available for export, and at a much higher price. and to make things even worse, oil companies are now shelving plans to expand refinery capacity, because the government (especially bush) is telling everyone they're going to cut gasoline consumption by 20%. The oil companies figure no point in spending 10's of billions of dollars to expand production when washington is promising decreased consumption. "

All excellent points, except I still believe the governments be huge beneficiaries as we will be using more gallons of fuel for the same driving. Gov't taxes per gallon & my sorry state has that ""gross earnings"" tax on 6.3% , going to 7% on July 1. Bush may be part of the problem but he's not the primary cause. In the last 30 years, every attempt to build a new refinery has been shot down. Then, there's ANWR, an area about the size on North Carolina...they want to drill in an area less than the size of my small town and think they're talking about something like 2 square miles. The left just doesn't want any new drilling in any area they can control (within US borders)...and they block new refineries. You're right on about corn to other countries and the price of beef and dairy. "

jd10013 ","
Your preaching to the choir, I agree with you on most of that. The reason no new refineries have been built is primarily because its more cost effective to expand existing ones, which the oil companies do. But, as recently as the early 90's (remember the recession and .69 gas) the oil companies had a lot of extra refining capacity. the growth in the economy, and boom in trucks/suv's has eatin up that excess capacity. Where bush is at fault is, he goes on tv pushing ethenol and prommising to reduce use of gasoline in the US by 20%. this makes it impossible for the oil companies to spend the billions of dollars necessary to expand capacity. It doesn't make business sense to increace refining capacity when the government (headed by, and including Bush) is saying we will actually need less refining capacity in the future by lowering demand.

I can certainly understand choosing a more rare car than going with the flow, especially when the differences in them get more and more slim with each passing model-change.Well stated. Very diplomatic. It was our gut feeling that there really were not a lot of differences in the mid-size sedan category, but that the Fusion had an edge in ""sportiness."" Plus we are fortunate to have a really exceptional Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer in our berg and have had generally good experiences with FoMoCo products as a rule of thumb.You mention your Focus wagon... I always admired those little cars. Great utility without the SUV mileage penalty. I sure wish Honda had more hatchbacks than just the Fit, that weren't SUVs (although the CR-V certainly blurs the line between car and SUV).The Focus wagon has been a great little utility vehicle, a mini SUV as it were. Unfortunately, Ford is doing away with all of its Focus hatchbacks and station wagons in 2008. The new Foci will only be available as a four-door or two-door sedan. If I were going to replace the Focus I'd probably go with the Honda Fit. That's about the closest thing to it, especially in the price range. The only other option would be a bare bones utility pickup, like a Ford Ranger or Mazda, which is a see-same deal.The AWD option is not something I would have ordered. That's how the car was equipped on the lot. It only snows once or twice a year in our section of Maryland. There is also a rather serious gas mileage penalty associated with AWD. Our V6 only manages 14.8 mpg in all-city driving after 3,200 miles, but will deliver 24-26 on road trips.Talk about ironies, we traded a 2000 Mazda Miata convertible in on the Fusion. The Miata, purchased new by my then 80-year-old Mother, only had 7,500 original miles on it. Mom only drove it to church on Sundays, to the grocery store, to the bank and to the beauty parlor.The Miata is definitely a true sports car, a ton of fun but not a very practical vehicle. We inherited it when Mom had an accident in it and I took away her driver's license.I really had my heart set on a new Accord. The wife wanted a Mustang. We compromised on the Fusion, which is absolutely one of Ford's better ideas in the last few years. The Fusion's styling is definitely bold, out of the mainstream. That suits us but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. To be sure, the Camry and Accord sit atop of the mid-size market segment, with good reason, I'm sure. "

I wasn't as concerned with the nameplate I was buying as I was the driving experience, and with our rough roads, the Accord has the best compromise of sport and comfort for my driving style.

In response to ZZzoom6's question, I ordered the Grand Touring 6i 5 door in early May. Dealer said it would take 6 weeks. I kind of doubted that but went ahead and ordered anyway. My instincts were right, as Mazda USA told me over the phone that the build date would not be until early July and and delivery mid to late August. She said it has to go to San Diego first and then to the Dealer here in northern california. (I don't know what they do to it in San Diego.) There is one Grant Touring 6i 5 door in California right now, but it's automatic. I wanted a manual. Hence the order....... Anyway I chose black leather, violet gray, satin fuel door, and wind deflector. So its loaded. BTW there are only a few ""touring"" 6i 5 door hatchbacks in California. Most are base models. I don't get it. Such a nice car with decent mileage. There are a few more v6's , but in my book well equipped 4cl's are the future, given prices of gas to come.

I budgeted between 20 and 25k for my purchase and I knew that I wanted something pretty fun to drive, something that had a comfortable back seat, and preferrably had a good deal of hauling capability. After my test drives, I thought the Accord, Legacy GT, and Mazda6 would meet my needs, so the shopping began. Once I saw what I could get a Mazda6 for, I jumped at the chance. It's been a great car that has exceeded my expectations. I'm sure I would have been happy with the other choices also, but looking back, I'm sure I would make the same choice today as I did over a year ago. And why the h*** would I want to buy an Accent? Just cuz it's cheap? When I buy something, I want something that I actually want. Not something I buy and regret later and end up spending more for what I really wanted... I still had criteria that I was going to use so I made sure I got what I wanted; something reliable, fun, practical, and comfortable. And I ended up with something that looked good too! I'm just saying that saving on up-front costs was more than just a number; it was money that could be used to get a great tv, a good camera, a better shifter, a nicer looking car, and a great storage system for the hatchback. These were things that I was going to buy anyway, but knowing that I got all these things sooner while still staying under budget is a huge bonus. "

Sorry to hear that you have to wait so long for your car... I know I'd be getting a bit anxious, especially every time I saw a 6 drive by on the road! I'm also a bit surprised that there aren't more of those around, particularly with gas prices being what they are. I drove the four cylinder manual around and I almost got that instead of the v-6 I got. It definately has a bit less understeer going into a corner so it's very fun to drive. Anyways, hope you get your car sooner rather than later... and if you have any ?s about your car, let me know. "

the 3.5 in the 500 was originally promised as a 2007 model to be introduced in the fall of 2006. This set of promises pretty much from day one - perhaps an apology for putting the 200 hp version DT in a car that big in the first place and certainly that car's 'fatal' flaw). Never did make it. In the meanwhile, lets try giving it a new name and then even miss that date by a little better than a month (originally promised for last April), and I'm still not sure there are any out there you or I can actually drive - or more to the point put in your driveway. Pricing is, however out and I'm sure Ford would be very happy to take whatever deposit money you wish to leave behind for the next product that is too little too late. Misinformation? Ford needs to get some communication going between those bean counters controlling things and those salespeople that promise things - a problem in Dearborn for several years now. "

That was a delay in development of the motor. Ford admittedly delayed it so they could make it more flexible for future applications. The Five Hundred wasn't the only model to suffer from that delay. The Fusion may actually even be suffering from it to an extent today and for a couple of years to come because production capacity is increasing slowly. If they had started building that engine two years ago maybe the Fusion would have it by now.The Duratec30 in the Five Hundred and Freestyle are low in the HP range but do perform rather well due to their CVT transmissions. From a marketing standpoint though, you are right, it was a ""fatal"" flaw.  "

this is suprising given that Porsche would have very little use for a 60d V6 in any of their products for the last 40 or 50 years, those engines being the boxer opposed 6s etc. Can't imagine that Porsche would have any reason to design something so rough and unrefined - maybe they gave up and found a willing 'sucker' in Dearborn, or maybe that Ford made some of their patented cost cutting 'improvements'.

my source for this came from a Ford sales manager back in spring 2005, after I test drove the 500 - hated the drivetrain (naturally), and told him so. Again, what sales people (or public relations folks) will tell you is often what they think you want to hear and not necessarily related to Ford's actual abilities to produce sufficient quantities to make promises come true. If it was, indeed, originally scheduled for the 500 debut back in 04/05, than I guess it is really about 3 years late, because you still can't get it in the thinly disguised Taurus. It will be interesting to see if the same sort of thing doesn't happen to the 'reengineered' 240hp 3.0 that I guess is 'scheduled' for debut in a 2010(?) Fusion. By then, it will be 10 years behind the Nissan VQ, 7 or 8 behind the Honda V6, and 5 behind the Toyota 2GR/Hyundai 3.3 and likely still not as good as any of them are today. Not to mention a solid 25 or 30hp (or more) - too little too late! "

The 924, 944, and 928 did not use boxer engines. Of course, some may argue these are not ""real Porsches,"" but you should drive a V8-powered 928 before that statement is made.However, you are probably correct in Ford's applied value-engineering. It may have been something totally different in the hands of Porsche. It is a rough-sounding engine, but once you look at the block, and underside design, of the engine, it's apparent the design didn't originate in Dearborn. The bottom end - externally - looks very European. Here's a copy-and-paste from WikiPedia on the DuraTec engine:""The 2.5 L and 3.0 L V6 Duratecs are evolutions of the same design, first used in the 1994 Ford Mondeo. It is a modern aluminum DOHC V6 with a 60° bank angle. The primary engineering input came from Porsche, who were developing a similar V6 before selling the engineering to Ford, and Cosworth, who helped with cylinder head manufacturing.The Jaguar AJ-V6 engine is similar but adds variable valve timing. Mazda's AJ version also has this feature.""Porsche and Cosworth (Mike Costin/Keith Duckworth) - not a bad lineage, even though the execution may not be to one's liking. "

and that 'hatred' might be a little strong. I have 2 big problems with Ford - 1) the historical fact that they have no ability to make a good smaller engine and 2) their current policies literally paying quite a number (thousands and thousands) of their employees not to work, the economic impact of which is, I guess, yet to be determined although I feel confident in saying that the upper midwestern states are generally hurting right now. What hurts those folks in Michigan, whether it be declining tax bases, swelling unemployment/welfare roles etc etc. MUST eventually hurt the rest of us as well. Their cars are, however, improving - finally - albeit with some rather ancient technologies. It is a fact that as go the (what used to be) Big 3, so goes the country. It is better for all of us that Ford, if it can continue to mfgr. in this country, if it sells a bunch of whatever they attempt to sell and if it makes a good solid profit doing it, does well. A helluva lot of 'ifs'. Wish them luck actually, they will need it, because none of these things are happening now or are they likely to happen in the forseeable future. In which case, this great country of ours will be facing the biggest business failure in history.to get back on this thread though, I'd hate to see truly good 'niche' cars like the Mazda 3/6s (blown 4 bangers notwithstanding), go down with the ship. My prediction - by 2010 or 12 Mazda will be sold off in a last ditch effort by its parent company to stay afloat and a few years later will become again the innovative and independent company (Toyo Koygo(?)) they once were.

oh come on now, by your own jaundiced view, the DT3.0 must have been just the right engine for the 500. It was so 'right' in fact that Ford, needed to discontinue it after a whole 3 model years, put a razor blade grin on it, add 60 apparently smoother and quieter HP, and give it a new name. If it wasn't the engine than what killed the car? Must be the lack of razor blades, because otherwise I thought the car was a quite well designed. Kinda like the Fusion, both cars well conceived AND in need of heart transplants. "

my problem with this is the same HP/lb.

Taking 3 steps back like this and going back even further to an early 90s engine, is not going to help FE and would kill power of course - buyers these days want BOTH.

beng one of those consumers that somehow doesn't 'see thru all the CR' - it is somewhat interesting to note that Sonata reliability ratings have fallen off in those 4 years since that article. Understandable, IMO in that it was a totally new car in 05. The Fusion been around less time, the jury must be regarded as 'still out', but it may hold its rather lofty position from a reliability standpoint in that in most respects it was not a truly new car at introduction. There are some advantages to using old engines/trannies and established chassis designs etc.. Ford would be doing a lot better if it could approach Hyundai's current product line. "

I like the idea, but I'd have to reserve final judgement until I had a chance to drive it and have at least a couple years to see how it holds up. I tend not to be an early adopter since unanticipated issues often come up even though Honda has done a pretty good job with their new products in the recent past. But I think a diesel would suit my current commute well(short, in city driving). On the other hand, I don't think my criteria for choosing a car would change; a 20% increase in fuel mileage would only save me $6 a week at the most. So that means it would take me 4 years to recoup the extra expense, assuming diesel costs 20% less per gallon. Since I probably will keep my car for 6+ years, it may make sense to go this route if driving dynamics and reliability are still good. But those are big ""if's"" and wouldn't buy into it until there was some good data showing it holds up. "

RE: Fusion being less expensive...While browsing at one of our neighborhood Ford motherships this weekend, I noticed that quite a few Fusions on the lot did not have ABS, which is a $600 option from Ford.I can't imagine anyone would NOT want ABS on their midsize sedan. And if Ford was looking for ways to make sure the published ""base"" prices would be less than the competition, I don't know that leaving ABS as optional was a good choice. It certainly doesn't help their safety image IMO.At least they added some structural reinforcements starting Jan 2007 to help try and get the frontal crash test results in line with the competition... but without ABS, Fusion drivers are more likely to experience a frontal crash than the competition.$600... that is 1/3 of the price difference between a Fusion S and my Accord LX right there (the Accord has standard ABS).

Do we have a bunch of teenage drag racers on this forum or what?Our 2007 3.0-liter V6 SEL AWD Fusion may not be a rocket but it certainly does have adequate pickup and passing ability. The fact that FoMoCo's 3.0 V6 is not as ""fast"" as a Honda V6, or a Toyota V6, or a Nissan V6, means nothing to me. Does that make me an old fuddy duddy?In real life, just how important (unimportant?) are 0-60 times? I just don't believe it is that big of a deal. The 3.0 may not be as sophisticated (new?) as some of the other power plants in the mid-size segment but it is certainly not an antiquated mil by any means. I mean, gee whiz, GM is still using push rod V8 engines.The other thing that bugs me is how some Camcord owners have this holier than thou attitude. Sure, Accords and Camrys are good cars but so are the Fusions and Sonatas. I see the mid-size sedan category as being the most competitive one in the marketplace today, with there being very little difference between the makes and models. Am I naive? Is there one car that is head and shoulders above the competition?OK, the Camry and Accord sell the most, by a large margin. Is it because they are clearly superior or is it because they are perceived to be? McDonald's sells more hamburgers than anyone else. Are they the best hamburgers, all being approximately the same price?We truly enjoy our $27,105 MSRP Fusion. The fit and finish on ours is perfect in every way.

My biggest complaint with all of this has always been seen in the ratios (which I've seen around here but don't know exactly how to link to them) of who buys what. According to what I've seen the vast majority of Camrys and Accords sold are equipped with an I4 and an ATX. The majority, although not quite as vast as that of the CamCord's, of Fusions sold are equipped with a V6 (ATX is the only option there). Don't know what it is for the Sonata.Knowing this I can't see how the size or power numbers of the V6 options in the CamCords sell the cars. I understand that their I4s are superior in pretty much every way to those of the Fusion and Sonata and have no argument as to why people buy them in insane numbers. So why put the Fusion down for its V6 when in all reality it is selling better than the other V6 options? The odds are in favor of the Fusion at the stoplight going by the numbers.I see the Fusion as a good compromise if you don't want an I4 and also don't want to pay the premium the models with the larger V6 options. The Fusion is never going to sell as well as the Camry or Accord without a better I4 but it's hard to argue that it doesn't offer a lot of value in it's current form.

dudleyr, I have an '05 Sonata and find nothing offensive with the words ""less expensive."" In fact, I'm quite happy with the car and its features (Special Value GLS) and tell people how relatively inexpensive it is. It was certainly less expensive than a comparably equipped Camry or Accord. I view that as a ""plus."" Afterall, people shop between dealers for the same make & model. Why,...because they are hoping to find a deal that is ""less expensive.""My Sonata hasn't required a single trip to the dealer for anything to be corrected or fixed. I opted to go a dealer for three oil changes, but they could have just as easily been done at the nearby gas station. I have been so impressed with the '05 Sonata after 2 years and close to 15,000 miles, that we bought an '07 Sonata SE as our second company car a little over three months ago.

If they can really make the car great, which is probably possible in the next year or two, and find the plant capacity to produce the numbers they'll need, think Taurus from '85 to the mid-90s, then we might see a Fusion that has what everyone hoped for in this iteration of the Fusion. I think Ford knew their limits and played it safe. Look at the Mustang. It's first two year's sales were a surprise to Ford. But there was nothing like it offered by anyone else so they had it made. I can't see that happening in mid-size world. "

You bought a great quality vehicle.I would like to think so. So far, so good. Six months and 3,200 miles later there has not been the first squeak, rattle or malfunction of any kind. About 95 percent of our driving is in-city and the gas mileage could be better but the revised EPA estimate for the V6 with AWD is only 17 mpg.Aside from the mileage issue, everything else about the car is perfect. We are very satisfied with our purchase. Yes, I realize that there must be many satisfied Accord and Camry owners, too. I, for one, choose not to bad mouth anybody else's product. To each his own I say.We've got a 10-year-old Ford Thunderbird with 85,000 miles on it and a 7-year-old Ford Focus station wagon with 92,000 miles on it. If the new Fusion holds up as well as those two vehicles have, we will continue to be very satisfied and continue to buy Ford products.Our Fusion seems to be a rock solid car and one that we would, at this point, wholeheartedly recommend. The bold, distinctive styling is a bonus, icing on the cake. "

All I remember about it though is that it didn't leave a very memorable impression...which probably means I didn't like it much. I spent a few days with the Sonata, which had the manumatic, and I really did not like that one at all; downshifts took way too long. By the time it downshifted, I was into the corner already! Even when I got more used to the timing, it just seemed to take too long. On the other hand, the Legacy, if I remember correctly - my drive in that was over a year ago, I thought was pretty good. But then again, that is a pretty powerful engine in the GT version so maybe my impression of the manumatic was colored by my infatuation with their powerplant. I'm glad I tried them... but if you want control over the power of the engine, manuals are the way to go. Even with stop and go traffic, I don't mind. One thing about the 6 is that first gear is perfect for just puttering along, something that I can't say about my old accord (perhaps hondas have changed, but my 96 in traffic was more of a chore). "

My biggest complaint with all of this has always been seen in the ratios (which I've seen around here but don't know exactly how to link to them) of who buys what. According to what I've seen the vast majority of Camrys and Accords sold are equipped with an I4 and an ATX. The majority, although not quite as vast as that of the CamCord's, of Fusions sold are equipped with a V6 (ATX is the only option there). Don't know what it is for the Sonata. Knowing this I can't see how the size or power numbers of the V6 options in the CamCords sell the cars. I understand that their I4s are superior in pretty much every way to those of the Fusion and Sonata and have no argument as to why people buy them in insane numbers. So why put the Fusion down for its V6 when in all reality it is selling better than the other V6 options? The odds are in favor of the Fusion at the stoplight going by the numbers. baggs32, It's not the power of the V6 engines that sell I4 Camcords. What you have failed to mention is FUEL MILEAGE. The I4 Camcords sell so well because they have V6 power (or close to it) and get much better fuel mileage than a Fusion V6 does. While the V6 Fusion may win from the stoplight (by a small margin), it will also be the first to pull into the gas station (by a wide margin).Of course, this leads the Fusion V6 owner to say ""My V6 Fusion will leave your I4 Camcord in the dust"". Which invariably leads Camcord owners to post Camcord V6 performance numbers. Not saying it makes sense, just saying that's the way it is.I don't have a problem with anyone buying the car ""They"" want. We all have our ""Own"" reasons. Just don't tell me I wasted thousands of $$ because I bought a Camcord. I bought a V6 Accord because it's what ""I"" wanted. Telling me I bought the wrong car, is like telling the Pope he picked the wrong religion.  "

You'd be amazed at the difference that made in how the car looked and even how it smelled (it didn't stink previously, but boy did it smell great after a carpet cleaning!).

I'll restate my version what he said since we don't completely disagree, hopefully in more diplomatic fashion.All of these competitors offer the same general features, at varying prices. The differences come in the presentation of all of it as a whole. How does the interior design feel; upscale or sporty? Boring but solid?How does the car drive; is it soft and buttery, sporty and rough, or somewhere in between?How are all the features of the car integrated together; does it come together as a cohesive unit?It is in these ways that the cars start to differentiate themselves, and it is basically personal preference. I found the Fusion to be too rough riding and the interior dated looking, the Sonata was numb/boring and had ergonomic quirks in the center stack that turned me off, and the Toyota was too soft and quiet, and not in the least bit engaging. They were all in the $20k-$24k range, all had between 155 and 166 horsepower, all offered automatics and 16"" wheels, and adequate interior space. It is the subtleties that won me over in the Accord; it had the right balance of features, a balance that was worth over a thousand dollars in order not to ""settle"" for something that didn't exactly fit my wants and needs.and if the accord was ""the total package"" why do they have to come out with another package in 08 LOL? For the same reason that all car companies improve their cars; the bar is always being raised. The same reason people are speculating over the Fusion getting a 3.5L, the reason the Altima got a power bump, and the reason that the Malibu made a 240 hp engine (Malibu SS) optional. You've got to keep up with the competition!  "

It's not the power of the V6 engines that sell I4 Camcords. What you have failed to mention is FUEL MILEAGE. The I4 Camcords sell so well because they have V6 power (or close to it) and get much better fuel mileage than a Fusion V6 does.I did say that in a round about way when I stated that the I4s of the Camry and Accord are superior to those in the Fusion and Sonata in nearly every way. The Fusion seems to fill a gap that no one else covers. V6 power for not much more cash than the other I4 offerings. You do lose some efficiency, but again, it is a compromise. Obviously it's not a compromise everyone is willing to make but the Fusion does sell well so Ford got something right somewhere.While the V6 Fusion may win from the stoplight (by a small margin)I've already shown that the difference is more than most think. The numbers for the I4 Accord that have been posted around here, which are pretty close to the Fusion's V6 numbers, were for one with an MTX. The I4 and ATX Accord are a good bit slower, close to a second IIRC. We just had a discussion about why anyone would want an MTX in a sedan so I'm guessing, and the sales numbers back me up, that stoplight matches between a V6 Fusion and MTX equipped I4 Accord are few and far between too.If the Fusion were available with an MTX then I'd expect to see mid to high 6 sec 0-60 times because that's what the Mazda6 accomplishes with an MTX and similar motor. Compare that to an MTX I4 Accord and the difference is around a full second again. So this brings me back to my original statement that the Fusion V6 is a good compromise if you want V6 power but don't want to pay the premium for the extra power of the Accord and Camry. With the Fusion you can get a V6 for a touch more than the I4 of the others which can be appealing all other attributes aside.In all honesty I'd only consider the Altima and Mazda6 in this category if I were in the market right now. They are the only two that offer an MTX with the V6, the performance I come to expect from such a drivetrain, and are visually appealing to me inside and out. I really don't like the Accord's or the Camry's outward appearance right now and the Fusion, said Camry, and Sonata don't offer an MTX with the V6 putting them all out of the running. Plus I did own a Mazda6 V6 previously and loved it making anything less too much of a compromise for me.  "

Just don't tell me I wasted thousands of $$ because I bought a Camcord.exactly - because the fact of the matter is that elroy5 very likely DIDN'T. Many autobuyers somehow confuse low initial price with 'value'. If an Accord costs 4 grand more up front but is still worth that same 4 grand more lets say 4 years later then than that more expensive car wasn't more expensive at all - except for the time value ($250-$350/year) of the extra money borrowed. Finance 101 and an easy concept to understand. The facts are that those Camcords do have the highest resale values and generally lead the pack in terms of cost of operation. A good indicator of a car's true cost to own is lease rates, I would suspect it may be actually cheaper (or close to the same) to lease an Accord compared to a Sonata or Fusion. But don't tell anybody that wasted anything or paid too much for anything - it is simply not likely the case over those 3 to 5 years that most of us tend to keep a car.and you are right, a Fusion/Sonata priced (and sold) like an Accord will likely never happen - simply because the carbuyer expects those cars to be cheaper and the main reason why those cars will be less valuable at trade-in time. There does seem to be about 3 Accord buyers to every 1 Fusion (or Sonata) buyer that seem to understand all this. So, therefore, this discussion really should be more about the relative merits of each car and less about silly price. "

Even if one vehicle has better mpg or is faster 0-60 or goes through the slalom or skidpad faster or is less expensive than another - most people don't base their purchase decision on those alone. It's a combination of very subjective things like interior/exterior styling, seat comfort, steering feel, power (how it feels as opposed to actual test figures), etc.If a test showed that the Accord was slower 0-60, had lower residual values and the worst reliability ratings of all the cars in this class - would that change an Accord owner's opinion of their own vehicle? Of course not. By the same token you're not going to change anyone's opinion of their own vehicle by spouting test results and magazine ratings. And it has nothing to do with justifying a purchase decision and everything to do with subjective preferences that can't be measured on a test track.Why can't we just note the objective differences between these vehicles without making judgements about which is better or worse?

There are so many different aspects to consider, and everything is constantly changing. Yes, my vote is for the Accord, but I certainly respect other choices (I've had two 626's before which I felt matched the Accords of their day in nearly every way).I view this discussion as a way to learn things about other cars in this class that you can't find out unless you actually own the car yourself, and I've tried to share such information about the cars I own or have owned.Please, lets be civil to one another, so we can keep the discussion going.

Toyota became the world's largest automaker by 1) producing quality cars and 2) correctly evaluating driver preferences where that car is to be sold. In this country, that means a 'soft isolating ride'. If anything I think folks are more likely to buy something that everybody else doesn't have other factors equal. I don't believe the fact that there are so many cars on the road that are identical to what I may have just bought is necessarily a positive influence on sales. "

All were decent vehicles.Bender, how many Accords have you owned? The Fusions come in three varieties, the S, SE and SEL with two engine options, I4 and V6. How many models of the Accord?This go round the wife got to pick the car (her first choice was a Mustang but that was not practical at this time) and we ended up with a V6 2007 SEL AWD Fusion. I've heard so many good things about an Accord that our next car might be one.So, what do you like most about your Accord? We like the styling of our Fusion a lot and consider it to be the best looking vehicle in the mid-size car segment with the Accord being second. "

You have acknowledged that subjective interpretation of characteristics and features differ for everyone, so I respect your opinion. But saying that the Accord is ""the total package"" as the other person wrote implies that it is the best for everyone and beyond improvement. That's just ignorant. It's all good that others have found cars that meet their idea of perfection or satisfaction and that the cars that they chose are different from mine or others. But to suggest that they know what the ideal is for everyone suggests that everyone must be like them or else they are not as perfect as them.

If a test showed that the Accord was slower 0-60, had lower residual values and the worst reliability ratings of all the cars in this class - would that change an Accord owner's opinion of their own vehicle? Of course not. of course it would, and of course it should Why? If I bought a vehicle and was happy with it why would I care about the other vehicles or where it ranked in testing? It might make me look at other vehicles when it came time to replace it but there is absolutely no reason that an owner's opinion of their vehicle should be changed simply because of some test results or magazine rankings.If it does then that says the owner cares only about what other people think of them based on the car that he/she drives. Maybe that explains why some of the Accord owners are so defensive when anyone dares to question the Accord's ""best in class"" status. "

If many of us were more generous with using ""in my opinion"" when making statements about what is ""best"" and it would be even more helpful if many of us would add ""for me"" to those kinds of statements.I know that a lot of people believe that since we are here to discuss opinions in the first place that those kinds of qualifiers are implied and need not be spelled out. I am suggesting that those of you who would like to keep this conversation civil and continuing can help those causes by using those phrases anyway.

If I bought a vehicle and was happy with it why would I care about the other vehicles or where it ranked in testingby testing I'm assuming you are really talking about more statistically related things like residual values or reliability numbers and not necessarily a few tenths or a second here or there in an acceleration test. The answer to 'why' is that if those Accords were really a reliability nightmares, those precious residual values suffered and that car started selling for a lot less money than what you paid for it, then it is hitting you right in the pocketbook. Buying a NEW car is an especially risky undertaking in these days of outrageous rebates and discounts simply because most folks are 'upside down' on their car notes as soon as they drive it off the lot. So sure, if that hypothetical bad model year Accord of yours effects me in the same way and I am losing even more money on it every day I keep it, my opinion of that car should change, even if that car is everything that I dreamed it would be.If it weren't for those 'badge' buyers there would be no market for a whole lot of cars that aren't even in this group and as far as getting defensive about buying an Accord, they don't need to - those same sales, reliability, and residual value statistics provide all the justification needed - it is best in class. Whether you or I agree, objectively or subjectively, is not the point. "

I've mostly owned foreign mid sized sedans.My first car, in 1996, was a 1991 Mazda 626 DX (stick shift, crank windows, manual locks, cassette deck...) which I got with 100,000 miles. This lasted 40,000 trouble-free miles, until I wrapped it around some trees. I walked away but the car was almost unrecognizable.My second car was a 1990 Honda Accord EX automatic, which was a fun car, except I ended up wishing for a stick shift. I got that in 1999 with 100k, and for the next 40,000 miles it was the least reliable car I have yet owned. (The first owners hadn't had any trouble in 100k miles, and I later tracked down it's third owner, who drove it until 240,000 miles with minimal problems so I must have fixed everything that needed fixing). No major replacements like engine or transmission, but lots of minor to moderate repairs, and it left me stranded a few times.My third car was a 1998 Mazda 626 ES-V6 5-speed, purchased in 2001 with 50k. This car was a champ; as reliable as the first 626, but with more power and luxury. I miss this car. I sold it with 100k on the clock, because I was working in sales at a Ford dealership at the time, and being around all of those new cars, I wanted my first brand new one. I sold the 626 with 100,000 miles in 2003 for $5,700. I later contacted the guy who bought it and he said he's had no problems, spinning like a top. Sellers remorse...The 4th car, my first brand new one, was a 2004 Ford Explorer. This was a tremendous value when new, and a shining example of engineering and vehicle design, however it was constantly plagued by minor issues since day one and I didn't trust it beyond 50K miles (the transmission had been acting up since new, and the rear end had started making noise, both symptoms of major trouble coming down the road). Never did leave me stranded, but was in the shop I think... 9 times? And still, it wasn't 100% right.And now, the new Accord. I bought it because the driving experience was almost exactly like that of the 1998 626. I wanted a Mazda6, but I saw that CR didn't rate the reliability any better than the Explorer (""average"") and I remembered back when I used to take the 1998 626 to the Mazda dealer how the advisor would tell me that my 2.5 V6 and manual transmission was ""bulletproof"" compared to the other combinations offered and compared to the Mazda6. I was afraid a new Mazda6 wouldn't be able to live up to the experience I had with the old 626's. So I thought I'd give Honda another shot. We'll see how it goes!I know Fusion is similiar and is rated as more reliable than Mazda6 (for some reason). I drove both the SE 5-speed manual and the SEL V6, but I just liked the Accord better. The 4-cylinder Fusion felt sluggish, and the manual transmission felt like an afterthought. The V6 didn't feel any faster than the Accord 4-cyl 5-speed, and was rated as having lower FE. Plus, I knew I wanted a stick shift. Mainly, the Accord reminded me more of the old 626, than the Fusion did. "

If I had a manumatic, I likely wouldn't use it unless I wanted to hold a gear for climbing/braking in hilly areas. It wouldn't be something I used in daily commuting. It would just be a more convenient version of what I already have (D, D3, 2, 1). I have that feature in my Mazda6 and that is essentially how I view it. I also think it is better looking version of the alternative, which would have 4-3-2-1 in line after D. There are also two other potential purposes that I see, one is to manually downshift early when you are planning to pass on a 2 lane road. The other is it allows you to start in 2 in the snow, which is somethng some people like to do...I've never bothered with doing that myself.I mostly drove manuals in my 30 years of driving, so I sure did not buy an automatic with a manual mode to pretend that I still have one. This feature is nice to have, but would certainly not be a deal-breaker for me. "

Its a fantastic car even tho its a 5 year old design! How many other 5 year old design cars can say the same?The 2008 model will surely be a hit - IN MY OPINION.

""I'm surprised that you gave Honda a second chance. The 1990 Accord EX must not have been too awfully bad after all.""Well, remember it went from new to 100,000 miles over 9 years with its original owners with no problems. And then, as I found out later, after I sold it with 140,000 miles the third owner put at around 80,000 or more miles with ""minimal problems."" Lets see, I'd have to pull the records, but off the top of my head... besides wear items and maintenance... intake manifold clogged (they had to drill holes), igniter failed (all electronics went dead including instruments as I was driving), starter solenoid problems, various electronic accessories failed. So no, not too awfully bad, no ""major"" repairs but it was the least reliable car I've had (except for the Ford, which is another story all together, but at least most of THAT MESS was under warranty so it doesn't seem so bad. I just had to endure lots of Ford Taurus loaner cars).I did get a 2007 Accord LX 5-speed, MSRP $20,200? I paid about $17,800 (or $300 under invoice).

Here's a thought on why it's important for some people to feel as if their car is ""best in class"": if someone pays a significant premium for a car, they probably expect it should be ""better"" than other cars that cost less. The ""more better"" their car is, the more value the price premium they paid has. OTOH, if someone buys a car that meets their needs, at a relatively low price, the fact that their car isn't ""best in class"" is immaterial. They got the car they wanted, at a good price, so that is what's important.It may also be related to how some people like to buy cars from brands that have more prestige among the general public. That extra prestige has value to them and helps them feel better about owning their car. The more prestige, the better. And ""best in class"" adds to the prestige of the car.Then there are those who don't care what the brand is, or even care if they are driving a 20-year-old rustbucket, as long as it gets them where they need to go.Different strokes for different folks. That's why brands like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus etc. exist and do well. "

We should have shopped around some more, obviously.I realize the Taurus was the best-selling car in America for several years running but they never did much for me. Of course the best-selling title now belongs to the Camry and they don't excite me either. Obviously my wife and I dance to the tune of a different drummer when it comes to the automotive world.Having many choices is a good thing, methinks. When it comes to popularity, I suspect Toyota and Honda will continue to lead the pack for quite some time.That's not a bad thing. It makes the ""other guys"" try harder, produce a better product.

Personally, the favorite in the clubhouse is likely the 08 Altima 3.5 but given that highly unlikely Accord/Fusion scenario you present - the 'new' engine for the Fusion is supposed to be another 3.0DT this time at a relatively paltry 240hp and may not make it until 2010 or even 2011, the new Honda V6 which likely will make it under the hood of the 08 should easily be somewhere in the 260-270hp range and be available not only on time but also offer a diesel alternative (less hp more torque and really great FE). The direct answer to your question, is no I probably don't rush out and buy that Fusion even if becomes (from a dynamic perspective) what you think it could, because that imaginary Fusion at least right now has neither the track record of long term reliability nor the history of high residuals that the Accord has maintained for 20 years or so. Do I go out and give it a hard look - sure, but those cars that have statistically proven to be 'better' in those reliability/residual value-cost to own studies will always top my list and after that it generally comes down to power and refinement under the hood, which generally is my true top priority.

Indeed, when it comes to styling and handling, the Fusion gets extremely high marks in my book.Let's face it, when it comes to cars, most owners are proud of their decision and eager to defend it. Since there are hundreds of thousands of Camry and Accord owners, the Fusion lovers are always going to be outnumbered and out voted in a popularity contest.At some point in the future that might not be the case (it wasn't always so) but for now it is.

not denigrating anything - just a simple statement of what Ford has already announced for the Fusion, if one chooses to believe it.

No they are not in the same class, but the same thing could happen within the same class. Someone could be shopping within this class, and say I know there are better cars in this class, but I will buy a Chrysler Sebring, because it's the car I like, and will cost much less than the class leader.

I keep my cars for at least 7 years. Some time ago, someone posted that Sonata's value would ""kill"" you if the car were totaled when it was only a couple of years old. That's not what kbb.com says about my Sonata at 14-15K miles. Retail $14,590, Private party ""good condition"" $11,460 & trade-in ""good condition"" $9310. And that's for the GLS, not the GLS ""Special Value"" which is essentially an LX except for leather and power driver seat. I paid $16,705 including doc fee, before TTL. (The doc fee was listed as a ridiculous $479, but it was built into the price so I didn't care.) Under CT law, an insurance company must pay the average of NADA retail ($12,700) and one of a few other ""recognized"" sources when a car is ""totaled"" in a collision or ""other than collision"" loss. So, If my car had been totaled yesterday I would received an insurance payment of $13,630 (less any deductible, unless someone else was at fault in an accident). That doesn't seem like a big depreciation hit to me for two years, only 19%. I think, and thought at the time, that Hyundai's improvements would show up in it's used car value within a couple years.

JD Power IQ is just a way to give awards to cars that would otherwise not win any. ANY car can have a problem or two. What's more important is whether or not the problem is fixed, or becomes something you just have to live with, as long as you own the car. Long term reliability is what I want, since I want to drive it for a long term (10 years or more). Obviously the more extra features or gadgets a car has, the more potential problems it could have. How many problems will the car have, after the warranty runs out? Do a survey on that, JD. "

Maybe that is the problem... so many people think their car is the ""best"" in its class. Well, maybe it is... for them, for their needs. That's why I bought an Elantra in the fall of 2000. It was not the ""best in class"" in the opinion of most people (although I think Edmunds.com made it one of their ""Most Wanted"" cars a bit later), but it was the best fit for my needs at the time. I actually liked it better than any other car in its class, and the fact that it was one of the least expensive cars in its class was a bonus. Currently, one of the cars I'm eyeing closely for my next new car is the Optima. I don't think it's ranked ""best in class"" by any professional reviewers.

For example, I find it very interesting that after many years of bottom-feeding in this study, brands like Porsche and now Mercedes-Benz and Kia are making huge strides in initial quality. I also find it interesting that some brands, like Lexus and Honda, have found a way to maintain their positions in initial quality, while brands like Toyota and Hyundai are backsliding a bit. And Ford is making impressive gains, as noted. The other interesting trend I see is a general increase overall in initial quality over the years. That is a positive trend for all of us. "

Agreed. Most makers are getting better and better which is great news for us consumers!! Even Land Rover, which had the largest improvement - highest decrease in number of problems from last year, though it still finished in last place :P Hyundai did too well last year by finishing in third Kia's was impressive - went from 24 to 12 Porsche continues to retain the top spot!!

JD Power IQ is just a way to give awards to cars that would otherwise not win any. Why? Just because Ford came out on top?How many problems will the car have, after the warranty runs out? Do a survey on that, JD.They do. http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pressrelease.aspx?ID=2006133And Mercury is number two. I guess that makes it a flawed survey, too. "

Disclaimer: the following post encompasses issues of quality and reliability rankings as related to midsize sedans only. (This is on-topic, I swear!) I don't give as much weight to JD Power as I do to Consumer Reports, because they report ""problems per 100 vehicles."" While this is useful data, I don't think enough weight is given to the severity of a particular problem. For instance, if midsize sedan ""A"" has 10 radio knobs fall off per 100 vehicles, and midsize sedan ""B"" has 5 transmissions fall out per 100 vehicles, sedan ""B"" appears to be of higher quality because it had less problems per 100 vehicles, even though the problems it did have were much more severe.Consumer Reports breaks the problems down further, so you can see the reliablilty rating for each car by categories such as Engine, Transmission, Body, Accesories, etc.I also don't place too much weight on ""Initital Quality"" surveys. They are a good indication that the vehicle will be reliable in the long run but that is not always the case. Vehicles which score well in initial quality can start to display major problems as they age, while vehicles that did not score well in initial quality can maintain reliability over the long term. Actual long-term reliability studies are much more valuable in my opinion. "

I didn't realize Accords started around $20,000. We should have shopped around some more, obviously. Accord VP would be even less than that LX. But, his car is not at all comparable to your version of the Fusion. A comparably equipped, 4 cyl manual transmission Fusion, would cost less than the Accord and much less than your Fusion. Since I have recently bought one, I know more about pricing of Mazda6 than the Fusion. A dealer near me had recently advertised Mazda6i SVE, with manual for $14K. That is better equipped than the Accord LX, more comparable to the Accord SE (which is priced $700 above LX). I paid $16K for that car with automatic (which adds at least $800). So this is evidence of a $2500-4500 premium for an Accord over the 6. I don't know if Ford is giving as good of deals on the Fusion as Mazda is on the 6. "

I really don't care much about these IQS numbers, either.However, CR has it's own problems, as well. Relying on self-reporting and evaluation of ""significant problems"" that may have occured as much as 12 months ago is just one. I actually give the most weight to the expected costs. This can be determined by pricing identical extended warranties from a single vendor for each model. Edmunds also bases their predicted repair costs on this. The differences between models of mid-size sedans are usually quite small. "

Um, that was last year. The latest report, which came out yesterday, shows Mazda in a lower position relative to other brands. Hard for someone who likes Mazda (which includes me) to see, but consider Mazda has released several new models in the past year. That may account at least partially for the relatively poor result for 2007. Same for Hyundai... with all the new models they have released in the past year, it is more difficult to maintain their high rating from the recent past. "

That 3 year study is potentially more useful to an extent, but think about what the numbers actually show. My wife's ""un-dependable"" VW would have 3 expected problems, while the super-duper dependable Mercury will have 1.5. I don't know about anybody else, but a difference of 1.5 ""problems"" during the warranty period is not going to sway me one way or the other. So what this confirms (for me) is that ""reliability"" is, for the most part, a non-issue in choosing a mid-size sedan.The typical range in expected repair costs of maybe $500 over 100,000 miles is also not going to influence my choice of midsize sedans.

those cars that have statistically proven to be 'better' in those reliability/residual value-cost to own studies will always top my list and after that it generally comes down to power and refinement under the hood, which generally is my true top priority.This from my post 1724, and I thought it answered your priority question pretty directly. More to the point is that, I probably don't buy the Accord or the Camry and lean towards the Altima (with that great V6 naturally). A car that does a relatively decent job holding its value (but not up to Camcord standards) and is admittedly short of Camcord type fit and finish - the redesigned 07 is a big improvement. Given that I believe that overall it falls short of Honda/Toyota then why is an Altima on the top of list? It's simple - experience - have put something in the neighborhood of 6-700k miles on my last 4 of them and not a one of them has ever had any problems, and that 3.5 V6 is outstanding. I did find the CVT disconcerting on the new Altima, but my wife loved it - it does make driving even less involving then even the 4 spd automatic in my current 3.5, so much so that I think that anybody that would even consider a stick will have no part of it.

I'd be glad to even though a Civic doesn't qualify for this discussion not exactly being mid sized. I bought the car new in Nov 2005 with about 9 miles or so showing. On the drive home from the dealer I noticed a faint noise from the right rear suspension on some types of bumps. I blew it off because this was a Honda after all (our first). My wife took over regularly driving the car to work and I only fueled, washed, and maintained it driving it short distances for those jobs. While I did start to notice an increase in the severity of the noise by July 2006 even my wife who wouldn't notice if she was dragging the transmission for 1/2 mile (an overstatement to be sure)said ""there is a noise in the car. I already knew a problem existed and researched for any Honda TSB's but didn't find one for this. I finally took it back to the selling dealer in late July where an inspection found not only was the right rear shock bone dry (all fluid leaked out) which is what I suspected but additionally the left side shock was leaking badly. Both were replaced under warranty BUT I had to take off a 1/2 day from work,wait around etc. That cleared up one noise but made things quiet enough I could hear another which was a ""drone"" from the engine at around 1500 RPM in high gear. Honda issued a TSB for this one much later and I got the fix which worked. Now, yet another noise, this one in the right front while hitting certain types of bumps has been identified as a faulty motor mount by Honda. This one is pending because I have not had the time to take it in for repair. Additionally, the interior plastic is very prone to scratches especially, as design would have it, near the armrests/door pulls where one is sure to blindly grasp to shut the door resulting in many scratches/scrapes there. But interior wise the worst problem by far is the fact the cloth upholstry material is wearing on the driver seat cushion bolster. The woven? in pattern has all but disappeared on a 3 x 2 inch or so patch where our butts slide on entering and leaving the car. Currently the car has around 8,700 miles and I feel while it has not had all the problems 2006 Civics CAN have there have been enough relatively minor problems to send me packing back to Hyundai. Scroll through the service bulletins for this year/model where at last count over a dozen exist and some are pretty ""bad"" e.g. about 7 ea. oil sealing bolts scattered around the engine that don't seal resulting in partial engine teardown for replacement. Power steering leaks, engine immobilizer problems resulting in no-start conditions etc. Nope whomever said reputation doesn't sell cars is wrong...it sold me a Honda. My first inclination was a 2006 Sonata but that is another story. "

An interesting post, target. Thanks for the info. I guess it illustrates that even Hondas can have problems. It's always been my contention that any make or model can have problems regardless of surveys or testings or ratings.We also considered the Hyundai Sonata but one dealer in our town owns the franchises for Hyundai, Mazda, Honda and Nissan while Sherwood Ford, Lincoln, Mercury has a sterling reputation and has been excellent to deal with. We own a 1997 Thunderbird and a 2000 Focus station wagon in addition to the 2007 Fusion.Eventually, all cars end up going back to the dealer for something, even if it is just oil changes or tire rotations. The dealer's excellent reputation was a big factor in our purchase of a Fusion. The bold, distinctive styling also played a large part.We've only had the car six months and 3,420 miles but, so far (knock on wood) it's yet to have a single squeak, rattle or thump. There has been zero recalls and not a single Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) has applied to our car. We sure hope this trend continues for the years to come. "

I realize that there is no ""right"" answer to this question; just wanted to know how others view this. I had a 220 hp SHO which was tested to 140 mph. It would also accelerate rapidly on an on-ramp and, with the 5-speed, pass quickly at highway speeds. Thus, 220 hp seemed to be as much, or more, power than I would ever need. Some recent comments have indicated that more power is needed to be ""competitive""; just wanted to know how other feel. "

I realize that there is no ""right"" answer to this question; The correct answer is there is no correct answer; just as you have stated. Our 2007 SEL AWD 3.0-liter V6 is rated at 221 horsepower. The V6s in Camrys, Accords, Auras, Sonatas, Altimas are rated higher, I believe.We find that the Fusion is fast enough, powerful enough for our needs but the gas mileage is really terrible, 14.8 mpg in all-city driving. In retrospect, the 160-horsepower I4 engine would have been adequate for the type of driving we do, 95 percent in-city travel with only two or three highway trips a year.It will be interesting to read other forum members comments on how much horsepower (get up and go) is enough.

I look at it this way. As long as I can get mid 20s mpg in town, and high 20s on the highway, I'll take all the power I can get. I can't imagine having too much power. That's like having too much money, there is no such thing IMO. There are luxury cars with a lot more hp (400 and more), and I don't think any of the owners are complaining that they have too much power. I would not complain either.  "

You say it is the ""highest selling car"" and ""regarded as the best"". The highest selling car can be easily defined, but is not always going to be ""regarded as best"". If it is not, then which is the ""class leader""? Sometimes there is no clear ""class leader"". The class leader can sell for more because it's the class leader. It doesn't become the class leader, simply because it has a higher price.If price does not matter, then maybe we need to consider whether midsize sedans like the Audi S6 ($72,000) or BMW M5 ($83,000) out-class cars like the Camry and Accord. These cars are in a different class. Who doesn't know this? They can be the ""class leader"" in their own class. "

The Camry is the class leader, so other car makers try to emulate it. Hyundai was following the ""leader"" when they designed the Sonata.

I believe the class leader in this segment, is the Camry even though the Accord is a better vehicle overall. The reason the Camry sells and sells is that it typifies what is needed in the segment. Decent, reliable, transportation, inexpensive to operate, room for a family. Toyota figured out what a family sedan was and rolled with it.As a car that I would buy, it's last on my list, but I wouldn't hestitate to recommend it (and I have) to people looking for a family sedan. People know what they get into when they buy a Camry, unlike Ford. There are a lot of people(at least that I know) that won't go near a Ford again. It may be perception, but it is a reality. Those that buy Camrys may rate them a ""5"", but they know the car will always be a five. I don't think people say that about Ford, even though the ratings may start higher. "

What do you drive now?I disagree with your comments regarding Ford but understand that you are entitled to your opinions even though they come mighty close to bashing a manufacturer, in my humble opinion, and that is something that is supposedly verboten on this mid-size sedan thread.I guess that you have conveniently forgotten all those years when Taurus was the No. 1-selling mid-size sedan by a large margin. IMHO Ford allowed the Taurus to die on the vine, did not keep pace with the marketplace which, in turn, allowed Camry to move into the No. 1 spot.Will Toyota remain there? Will Honda move up? Will the Ford Fusion catch on and become No. 1? Will Sonata sales soar at some point in the future? And what about the Aura and the Altima? Will a Chevrolet Malibu work its way up?Will Camrys be smitten with another problem like the terrible oil sludge debacle?Maybe I am not typical, but I have always had good experiences with Ford products and currently own three of them, a 1997 Thunderbird with 85,000 miles, a 2000 Focus station wagon with 92,000 miles and a 2007 Fusion with 3,400 miles.Would I buy another Ford product? You bet. Have I ever owned anything manufactured by Honda or Toyota? No, but I have owned three Mazda products, which were also fine vehicles.It's my guess that the Honda Accord is destined to become the No. 1-selling mid-size sedan and that's fine with me.

Just too many bad experiences in the past. And that's not unusual, most people who have a bad experience with a car won't buy from them again. But, I think in the case of ford, they let quality control durring the 90's slip to a level where they alienated a lot of past customers. I don't think they did it on purpose, they just figured the future was in SUV's and Trucks. They paid a lot less attention to, and spent a lot less money on their passenger cars. And it's not my intention to bash Ford, just reality. They'll recove eventualy, and if their cars don't, they sell enough trucks that they will always be a big (even if not the biggest) player in the automotive market. "

All are ok, and as you'll see, the damage is purely cosmetic. I know this isn't exactly on topic (although it IS a car listed for this page! :P ) but I appreciate y'all listening to me; we're a midsize sedan family, ya know!? Long story short - Heavy traffic. Two-lane interstate each direction, 70 MPH. I'm in the left lane keeping up with everyone, doing about 70 (right lane was slooooow). Crazy-guy tries to pass me on inside shoulder unsuccessfully (he ran out of grass and nearly hit a guardrail). He is able to pass on the right (remember, I'm keeping up with what is in front of me within about 4 carlengths the whole time). He swerves over, and clips me. The policeman said it was obvious he wasn't telling the truth, and I was, based on the damage pattern and my story. He got out of his car playing it off saying ""it was just a fender bender, no big deal."" I may file a complaint at the courthouse, the policeman told me it was at my discretion to do so.My parking light is missing, and my passenger side low-beam doesn't work, but both highbeams work, as well as the blinkers. Nothing too much seems to have happened under the hood. I drove it up to 70 MPH last night after it happened with no problem. When I had to turn off my high beams, I had to slow way down though, with only one light!Here's one pic, the rest can be found on my carspace page. See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.com "

In 2 years - I have been totally stoked with this purchase, my only remorse being that it is the base model wagon and in hindsight, the model up with more doodads would've been desirable, but the model we got undercut the cost of an Accord, so I definitely can't complain about the diesel.Toyota bought GMs chunk of Subaru (and a little more, I believe) mainly to get access to manufacturing facilities in Indiana, but I would expect to see the typical Toyota pairing down of models to the one-size-fits-most level.

And I thought I got a great deal on my car at about 7k off msrp! If you are planning on keeping the car for a while, then that's an amazing deal. But if you are going to trade it in in the next few years, an 06 has depreciated a lot already. So is this the sedan w/ leather? Also what color? The only color that I thought I wouldn't like in the 06's was the burgandy one, but I saw it in person and it looks good. Anyways, if you are happy with the car and how it drives, I'd have to say the price is awesome so that should be that. Good luck! "

with mazda coming out with some new models this year (cx-7, cx-9) I'm not too surprised at mazda not doing well in the initial quality report by JD powers. But keep in mind, the long term tests have shown that the mazda6 is likely to have one extra problem over a 5 year period over the camry or accord, so in general it has been a very reliable car based on data from jd powers and consumer reports. Also, the latest crash tests of the mazda6 with side airbags show the car to be quite safe. One thing though, there is not an auxilary input for mp3 players and I don't think the cd player will accept them. I recently installed an auxilary input in my 6 and I was able to choose where I wanted the jacks (yes I put in two input jacks...one for an mp3 player in the armrest, and another that plugs into my gps around the compartment in the dash). But if having support for your mp3 player is important, there are some options available that are easy to install - mine took about an hour and I'm not mechanically inclined at all. "

It's a V6. Standard features are impressive to say the least. 17' alloys, ABS, traction control, 6 air bags, power seats, anti-theft device, remote keyless entry.

The best thing about the car is the chassis. V6 may have less power than honda V6, but with that chassis it will be faster in the real world.Yeah, I'd have to agree with that. Grip in turns is just amazing for a midsize sedan and it corners so much flatter than other cars in this class which is probably why it feels so composed. And the strange/ great thing is, it doesn't have a harsh ride. Usually with a suspension that is really good in mid-corner, most cars tend to get a bit harsh, but I think the Mazda6 is very well dampened when hitting bumps. It's the best of both worlds and is what makes the 6's chassis so highly regarded.I bought my car in Nov of 05 so the 06's were out already and I bought a 2005 leftover with manual tranny, v-6, bose and sunroof for 19.5, so you're getting about $400 less in net options (you'll have auto, but no bose/sunroof) w/ an extra 3k off what I paid. Plus your car will be much easier to keep clean than mine which is dark grey...one thing I love about silver cars. So to get that price, do you have to finance through Mazda? I had to in order to get an extra 1k in rebates, but I paid mine off in a few months with another loan w/ lower interest so no big deal. I'm just amazed at the deal you're getting... btw, if you do a fair amount of grocery getting, check out the organizer tray for the trunk... it's awesome for keeping things from rolling around and getting damaged while taking corners faster than you should with a dozen eggs in the trunk :shades: "

you'll have to forgive scape and akirby, anything that even can be construed as slightly negative on the Fusion is by definition 'Ford bashing'. The fact of the matter is that all cars, even Camcords, have things about them that 'lag' the other cars in this group. The Camcords can be 'bashed' for high initial prices, difficult dealers, and in some opinions styling, the Fusion certainly for its substandard powertrains, no ESC, and relative interior fit/finish. The car that I'm surprised we don't hear about more on this forum - the Aura XR - a really good effort on GMs part IMO. I agree that any car should usually provide that 100k of relatively troublefree service including those Camcordimas and Fusions.

does leaving between 20 and 50 HP on the table to all the cars in this group while offering no advantages in FE qualify as 'substandard'?

'Adequate' or 'not bad' by most definitions does not equal 'class leading', IMO. Again IMO, the Fusion/6 are well designed cars that do have some good points, but not anything you'll find under the hoods relative to what else is available in this class. And I can't imagine that you or anybody else can consider this 'bashing' a simple review of drivetrain/FE specs along with hopefully a few test drives are all most folks should - one way or the other.

Who said that 240+ hp in a FWD family sedan is ""standard""? You seem to be caught up in some engineering competition. I'll certainly give you that - the DT3.0 does not represent state of the art in engine design. Ford's entry in that competition would be the 3.5 and it is competetive. The DT3.0 also probably a lot cheaper than the other V6s including Ford's own 3.5L (until production is ramped up).However, in the real world application of a midsize family sedan the DT3.0L is perfectly adequate and not substandard to anything.

Spin it all you want the fact is that Fusion's V6 is at bottom of the pack.For me (and probably a lot of other V6 buyers) 221 hp is more than enough and I could care less if the competition has more.Fine, so the Fusion's 221 HP is more than enough for you but that still doesn't change the fact that it is trailing others in the power output department. Believe me, I myself is a horsepower nut and that's why I don't drive a midsizer anymore (the reason I am here is because I think this is the most interesting segment and I used to own a 97' Honda Accord LX. Also, I might be soon to help my sister and parents to purchase another 2 midsizers).

calling the engine in the fusion/6 sub-standard is like calling the brakes in the accord sub-standard since the accord takes 20 longer feet to stop from 70mph than the camry and ranked the lowest in the c&d comparo vs 5 other midsizers. But the truth is, is that 194 feet from 70 isn't all that bad and to suggest that the Accord's brakes are sub-standard is a stretch and an exageration. It could be, and often is, said that the Accord's braking performance is a bit long for it's class, but labeling it sub-standard would suggest that it is unsafe and inadequate for driving safely. But the thing is, when a car is evaluated, it is the WHOLE car that should be evaluated. While individual components are important, just because one component is not as good as it's competition should not be that big of a deal. And I don't think anyone here is saying that the Fusion/6 v-6 is TOO slow to be considered fun/ safe. In the end, I'd rather have an engine that takes a couple more tenth's to get to 60mph than to have a car that takes an extra 20 feet to avoid an accident.One other thing...how often is a car pushed where the engine is actually outputing that extra 20 or 30 HP? Though I like to drive to have fun, very rarely am I pushing my car to where I am using all 220 HP. And even with my ""measly"" 220HP engine, I'm still faster than more than 90% of the cars on the road so if that's substandard to you, so be it. And I don't think that a car with a substandard engine would make Consumer's Digest's Sportiest Car list, Edmund's Editor's most desired sedan under 25k, or Esquire's most desired cars list. Just like the Accord isn't precluded from winning it's awards despite having brakes that stop a bit longer than most of it's competition. "

The exchanges on this forum certainly are lively and entertaining. For the record I'm not here to bash anybody's product or opinion.That being said, our 2007 V6 SEL AWD Fusion ($27,105 MSRP) is the nicest car my wife and I have ever owned, dating back to 1958.The 3.0-liter, 221-horsepower engine is more than adequate in all driving situations. It is coupled to a best-in-class six (6) speed automatic transmission that is flawless, smooth as silk in all driving situations.OK, the Fusion is not the fastest mid-size sedan 0-60, but how many people truly engage in stoplight racing? How many people really care about such things? The Fusion is certainly not under powered. At least not for us. It is a tried and true power plant known for its reliability, dependability.The fit and finish on our Fusion is simply outstanding. It could not be any better. Perfection cannot be improved upon. Is this typical? I don't know, but ours is this way. Everything looks as it should, works as it should. After six months of ownership there has not been a single squeak, rattle, thump or bump in the first 3,400 miles of operation.One of the biggest selling points for us is the bold, distinctive styling. The Fusion is unique in its looks and this is a very good thing in our book. The other cars in the mid-size sedan category look bland, to us.Our Fusion is loaded with creature comforts and safety features. It handles like it is on rails. The ride is extremely comfortable, yet sporty, thanks to 17-by-7.5 inch machined aluminum wheels and P225/50R/17 Michelin Pilot tires.In short, we bought a car that was best for us. We're sure that many Camry, Accord, Aura, Altima, Sebring, Legacy, Sonata, Mazda6, etc. owners feel the same way about their automobiles.Could Ford improve the Fusion? Yes, and is doing so for the 2008 model year. Could all of the other cars in the mid-size segment be improved in some way? Of course.We think Ford has a genuine winner in the Fusion, a product that is a better idea, a bold, distinctive one at that. "

I will throw this out.I am totally in agreement with those who claim the superiority of the Honda Toyota et al engines. However, this is because of the their greater fuel efficiency, not because of their power. In regards to power I agree with the Ford camp that says 220 is plenty. 220 is more than enough. I had a Taurus with the 140hp Vulcan, and not once did I think it needed to be faster - many times I wished it got better gas mileage though.What if Toyota put the technology in their 3.5 liter engine into their 3.0. So what if it was down a few hp. It would still be plenty fast and would get even better mpg.We are sending far too many dollars to OPEC countries. Fuel economy is not just about dollars saved.To be totally honest, a v-6 is superfluous in the vast majority of situations. Fun...yes, but so is the I4 with a stick.Besides if you want fun just buy an old Miata - to bomb around in on the weekends. Most daily commutes generally do not offer very many oppertunities to have ""fun"" with the engine. The gas saved and the purchase money saved will easily pay for the Miata.Why cruise around with all that power only to use it a small percentage of the time? As it is I rarely get a chance to put the spurs to my I4. Though I do consider buying an overly powerfull engine to be wasefull, I would certainly not put it in the same category of wastefullness as commuting to work in a Suburban by oneself.Understand, that I am speaking in general terms. I know some people with V-6 engines that get better mpg than those with the 4-cyl (mostly due to driving style and transmission choice).To finish up, I really look forward to seeing the new crop of more efficient drivetrains in the midsized segment - especially the diesels.

Clean sheet for Ford - compared to the existing Taurus. The Taurus was replaced by 2 vehicles - the Fusion and the Five Hundred (now renamed Taurus). Yes, for the Fusion they started with the Mazda6 platform but they lengthened and widened it. The Five Hundred started with a Volvo D3 platform. And last time I checked Ford owned Volvo and a controlling interest in Mazda. That's like saying Acura borrows from Honda or vice versa. It's all the same company.Speaking of facts - the AWD system used on the Fusion is NOT the same one used by Volvo. It's an all Ford in house engineered version. The DT3.0L is not the same engine used in the Taurus. The Taurus never had VVT. THIS is the type of misleading misinformation about the Fusion that I'm talking about. Next you'll claim the Escape Hybrid's powertrain came from Toyota (which is also not true). "

well then I guess we have a difference in definitions, 'clean sheet' to me means something new and/or not used before - something that only the Sonata in this group has a reasonable claim to. The Ford 'VVT' and please correct me if I'm wrong, is not the same sort of thing as the Toyota CVVTi, the GM CVVTi, the Nissan and Hyundai VVTi, or even the Honda SOHC VVTi engines - maybe a reason for the HP/efficiency/refinement differences? As far as who owns who it really makes no matter, there is little in the Fusion that hasn't been done before and it is anything but 'clean sheet'. Maybe not such a bad thing - and maybe something that has contributed to the Fusion's rather good initial and probable future reliability ratings...WHAT MISINFORMATION - is simply adding a rudimentary VVT system to an existing 10 year old engine make it a 'new' engine, or taking an existing chassis stretching it a couple of inches make it a new chassis?If it makes you feel any better, Nissan is a champion at this kind of thing, taking a single chassis design (the FM), a single engine (the VQ) and turning it into a whole product line of 'different' vehicles, all of which are anything but 'clean sheet'.

However Mazda's VVT on the Duratec30 in the Mazda6 is similar to those above yet does not offer more power or efficiency. Ford seems to have found something else that allows for the extra power but at lower RPMs. You have to rev pretty high in the Mazda6 V6 to get to the power. Or at least I thought so when I owned one.

have no idea how old you are, but back in the stone ages we could put 'grind' cams in our big ole V8s which would simply change the valve opening timing and duration realtive to piston travel to produce that nasty thing called HP - all at the expense of low engine speed behavior, that 'loping' exhaust note that some of those 'muscle' cars had. These newer high tech systems (much like what's in the Toyota 2GR) take this principle several steps further - continuously adjusting intake and exhaust valve timing in response specifically to what a computer thinks the engine 'needs' optimizing efficiency, HP, torque, and decreasing emissions. Last generation - this is a simple physical camshaft position change that generally occurs at higher rpm, in effect it is on or off, and likely responsible for that 'kick in the butt' that you felt in you old Mazda.

I contend that, in effect, it was the 3.0 that killed the 500 and turned it into the 'new' Taurus.

They had a name sitting on the shelf with 80% recognition and an existing name (five hundred) with only 30% recognition. It was a no-brainer. The idea was hatched by Ford Division's new marketing guru, Barry Engle, following an exchange with a handful of journalists prior to the Detroit auto show in early January. Engle acknowledged to the press that he, too, thought killing Taurus had been a mistake. (He could safely say that, since he was far away, handling Ford's marketing in Brazil, at the time.)The next day, Engle kicked the idea of a reincarnation up the ladder to Cisco Codino, the marketing group vice president, and Mark Fields, president of Ford North America. The trio took it to Mulally, who gave it an enthusiastic thumbs-up. The entire decision was made in a matter of days, according to Ford sources. "

the Five Hundred is a car that I considered a coupla years back, had you put 260hp or so in it instead of 200, the car would have been an instant hit IMO and possibly now in my driveway, name recognition notwithstanding. The car is one well designed 'space ship'.Under the assumption that the the 3.5 is more refined than what it is supposed to replace, the Fusion would be a rocket ship running the same sort of 6 second 0-60 times we see in some of the other cars in this group, and in my own estimation, would sell better so equipped - at least to those of us that are self admitted HP addicts. It is a shame in my mind that the Fusion V6, Sonata, and GM pushrod V6s find themselves competing against 4 banger Camcords (probably because of price) - for folks willing to make the '4 cylinder sacrifice' (and yes I expect some grief for this comment), fuel economy considerations are perhaps critical, thereby making the V6 models a tougher sell? Bottom line if Ford wants to sell a V6 anything as a V6, it needs to have that 250+hp if for no other reason then that is what everybody else is doing. Remember that it was Nissan that really started the HP race in this class (2002 Altima), joined shortly thereafter by Honda, and only recently trumped by Toyota's efforts - the 3 cars sell over a million copies a year combined, and it is not Ford (or GM/Chrysler) that controls and dictates this market anymore.

These are some quotes about the DT 3.0 in the Mazda6:from car and driverWhen I drove a preproduction four-cylinder, five-speed Mazda 6 i, last fall, I came away impressed, yearning only for another 25 horsepower and a slicker gearbox. Yearn, and you shall receive. Instead of a couple dozen more ponies, Mazda added 60, courtesy of a 3.0-liter V-6. It has variable valve timing, and smooth and quiet power delivery reminiscent of a BMW in-line six's.from automotive.comThe 3.0-liter V6 in the 6s greatly increases the fun. Like the four-cylinder, it has continuously variable valve timing (VVT) for its intake camshaft; but on the V6, this feature seems to be used more effectively, providing better low-down torque along with a willingness to rev, with good gas mileage and a nice set of sounds from the air intake and the dual exhausts.from motortrend:Mazda's variable-valve timing sure brings Ford's 3.0-Duratec to life. At part-throttle in the midrange, it almost feels like a light turbo."" Another editor wrote, ""While it's not as sweet and reedy as the Honda 3.0-liter V-6 and gives up a few horses to the Altima VQ family 3.5, it's still a fine piece and fully competitive in this class.""from AutoWeek:The exterior is a lot louder than the interior, though, where you need to eyeball the tach to see if the engine is running at idle, and the drivetrain doesn&#146;t even make a lot of fuss up near redline. Zings right up there, though, delivering a strong dose of performance&#151;after you get off the dime. from Esquire's Best 10under50KThe secret of the 6's appeal is in the details-the chunky feel of the shifter in your hand, the smooth, eager power delivered by even the base four-cylinder. Though this is a bread-and-butter family car, it's clear that the people who tuned the steering and suspension care about driving. The 6 constantly surprises with its abilities. Go ahead, put five golf bags in the trunk. Somehow, they fit. This is the kind of car you name and keep driving long after it's paid for. Maybe you could afford something else, but the 6 gets under your skin.from Car and Driver:Twist the key and blip the throttle to transform a quiet idle (at 40 dBA, it's 5 dBA more hushed than the new Honda Accord V-6) into a feral snarl. Under way with the hammer down, there's 76 dBA of baritone roar, the timbre of which suggests it originates in Yankee cubes rather than high-tech cams. "

I knew I would get somebody's dander up with the 4 cylinder comment. And yes I have a basic misunderstanding of why we would want 160 hp and maybe 200 lb ft of torque even trying to pull around 3300 lb vehicles.Your point about 'never' using anything more than 60% throttle is probably pretty close to accurate but not the point IMO. It is those times few and far between like safely and quickly merging onto a fast moving highway off a short on-ramp, or possibly making an easy pass of that semi on a 2 lane highway that can and do make a good V6 inherently safer all other factors equal. Power in reserve (within reasonable limits) is generally better than none or little. The question, to me, is whether that security and the generally smoother/quieter operation that a good V6 provides is really worth the mpgs they will invariably cost you. Yes, I currently own two cars both which will run in the 6s 0-60 - the number of times it actually is ever used damn few - do I feel better though with my wife in a car that provides that extra margin - sure do. BTW neither of us drive the way that you seem to think we must, licenses are too valuable, insurance rates are too high, and we are certainly too old for behavior like that.

there are a couple of simple answers to this -1) cost - the Sonata, the V6 Fusion, and even the pushrod equipped V6 Malibus will price at about the same dollars as the Camcordima 4 bangers - getting a good 'discount' on any car up front becomes a badge of honor (and ego gratification) for most new car buyers who somehow seem to forget the back end implications (those dreaded residual values) of those lower initial prices.2) FE - folks that buy vehicles in this class are generally more conservative types (none of these cars are 'sports cars') and are therefore more likely to put a much higher value on those extra mpgs.

I didn't say that all - but I will agree that unfortunately many buyers treat the V6 as a generic item in a midsize sedan - a serious mistake IMO there are a few in this group that only meet the definition, and there are others that are really good sophisticated engines. A car enthusiast will know, understand and appreciate the differences, your 'majority of midsize sedan buyers' are really wanting only a good reliable appliance - there is nothing wrong with that. In my own case, I would enjoy a good 4 banger (Honda's comes to mind) long before I could tolerate a DT or one of those GM pushrods. Different strokes for different folks, but your inference seems to be that since the Fusion sells more V6s than Honda it must somehow be better (or at least equal to) - a ludricrous stretch because there is simply no comparison in power, efficiency and/or refinement -it is only a function of how cheap the Fusion is relative to the Accord. The Sonata is the one that is at least in the same neighborhood in that respect and they too sell far more V6s again as a function of how cheap they are. Give me a choice between a Sonata and a Fusion, the Sonata gets my bucks - Hyundai has been doing some good things lately. "

no, the average buyer won't really notice that extra second or so - but he/she should notice how it feels and sounds getting there as well as the few bucks they likely save at the pumps, and they would also likely notice that the Camcord is probably worth that same $3-5k more at trade-in time.

In my opinion this is an excellent move by Saturn, and I suspect they will see some increase in sales as a result. This is light years ahead of the ""Fusion Challenge"" because I beleive this will actually get some more people into Saturn showrooms (heck, I have one a mile away that I've never been to, and I'm thinking about going just to check out the spectacle). You've got the fairly basic models of all three cars, comparable in *sticker* price (the one flaw is that Saturn won't budge wheras the Japanese usually will), and they can showcase all of the awards the Aura has.Plus if they really do ""pamper"" the customers I'm thinking it will get some people all worked up. Additionally, unlike the Fusion challenge, the people who get all excited during the test drives will actually be able to buy an Aura right then before the excited feeling wears off.I've never driven an Aura; I'll report my experience.

Very interesting discussion on GM's Accord/Camry tactic. As an aside, I've recently had the pleasure of renting a Altima [EDIT] 2.5S and driving a couple hundred miles in it, back and forth between NYC/NJ/Philly.First, let me say that this vehicle's glaring omission is its lack of standard ABS. In a rainstorm yesterday, this becaming frighteningly apparent on the NJ TPK as I had to jab the brakes quickly due to rubbernecking, and the front tires locked-up momentarily. As if a Taco Bell lunch needs further encouragement through my digestive system!Crisis adverted, no drama ensued, but still.. it's practically the 2008 MY, this vehicle costs $21K at MSRP, and ABS is minimally expensive nowawdays, so what gives, Nissan?That aside, this car is fantastic. Sure, I'm still not convinced by the fuzzy, cheap felt on the outer edges of the seats, but that's so easy to overlook given the interior's many other virtues, from a super-easy to use trip computer, to well placed dash vents and logical climate controls. And the base stereo is even pretty decent (though I like the Camry's trap door for the iPod better than the Altima's jack). Additionally, seating is comfortable, passenger room copious, and steering wheel easily customizable for drivers of various shapes and sizes. Finally, all buyers get the simple but totally trick Intelligent Key? Sweet!Where this car shines though is in its ultra-responsive and smooth (especially for a 4) powertrain. The CVT is worlds above those offered in Dodge/Mitsu products, and this 2.5L feels nothing if not 3.0+ litres in size. I've even gotten an indicated 25 MPG since rolling out of the Enterprise parking lot, despite lots of sitting in traffic and, shall we say, liberal throttle applications when not.Handling is as one would expect given Nissan's pitch of the Altima; composed and engaging. Kudos.Seriously, pending crash scores, I can't imagine why this vehicle wouldn't be on the shopping list of buyers in this segment. This is, far and away, the 4 cylinder that I'd pick. Make mine with ABS and the Convenience Package, though (which really does add convenience, btw, as the power driver's seat likely cures some of the limited flexiblity between the standard seat's incline and slide detents)Heck, I'd take this 4 over the V6 iterations of the Sonata and Fusion, too. I haven't driven the Altima V6, but it would be a tough call between this and the Camry SE V6 or the Accord V6s (due to their tremedous value right now and general competence despite age). If I wanted lux, I'd probably go Camry XLE V6, though.IMO, if Nissan continues cranking out winners like this, Shift 2.0 will be nothing short of phenomenal.

I don't think it's a risk at all. GM must do something to make buyers actually compare the Aura to the Accord and Camry and show them how well the Aura stacks up. This is as good a way to do it as any.I expect what Saturn is doing is pitting the Aura against like-priced Camrys and Accords. That would mean, for example, the V6 Aura vs. a relatively bare-bones Accord/Camry I4. I have done just this sort of comparison at my local auto show, and IMO the Aura looks very good in this kind of comparison. For example, it has large, nice-looking alloys vs. (probably) plastic covers on smaller wheels on the Camcord. It has the V6 vs. the I4. It has a much classier looking exterior I think, and the interior compares well, at least to the extent someone would compare them on a showfloor. You also have other plusses with the Aura, including OnStar and the hassle-free buying experience Saturn offers (not to be overlooked for many buyers tired of what they have experienced or heard about shenanigans by Honda and Toyota salespeople).So I think it's a good move by GM--even if it means that Honda and Toyota just sold nearly 500 cars each in June.I'd like to see Hyundai try this with, say, the Santa Fe, RAV4, and CRV, or maybe the Elantra, Civic, and Corolla. Or more on topic, the Sonata, Camry, and Accord. Before the new Accord comes out, preferably.  "

If you don't see the correlation then you just don't want to see it. Even the dealers said the ads were bringing in more buyers.Fusion fleet sales are holding steady around 18% last time I checked. They are NOT dumping cars into rental fleets. Instead they're slowing production to match demand instead of throwing huge amounts of cash on the hood. Even the slow selling Five Hundred never got huge rebates like it would have in the past. The days of rental fleet dumping are over.Having AWD was the main point of the Fusion challenge - you can get an AWD Fusion V6 for the same price or less than the FWD competition. If Toyota wants to do their own test with a SE model - go right ahead. But if they had used the SE model then everyone would have complained that the Fusion was better equipped since it was a top of the line model. "

Percentages are for those who don't really understand numbers. As an extreme example (but the percentages apply :P ) : buy a car for $20K and turn it in for $12K (that's 60%) and it cost you $8K depreciation. Buy a different car for $16K and turn it in for $10K (that's 56.25%) and it cost you $7K depreciation. The first car retained a higher % of it's original cost but cost $1K more in REAL dollars. Do percentages pay your expenses or do you pay them with dollars? Another example of percentages not being real: If you make $200 a week and get a 50% pay cut for a month, you'd get $100 per week. Then the situation improves and you get a 100% pay increase, which restores you to the original $200 per week. The dollars are the same but the percentage minded people would be inclined to think you were better off with a 100% increase after suffering ""only a 50% temporary cut."" "

Better be worth 3-$5K more at trade inand if we make the assumption that it will be (while Ford has had a checkered past in the residual value dept, we simply don't know yet about the Fusion - the Camcords OTH each have about 20 years or so of great residual values), then that Camcord really only costs about $200.00/year to own than that Fusion - that $200.00 'average' interest you pay on an extra $4000.00 per year - keeping in mind that the principle difference will also narrow because your payments are obviously higher and that loan principle difference reduces with time. Is it worth an extra $20/month to drive an Accord let's say - that is buyers choice, but it is also a cost that you might also recover just in the FE differences.The Accord actually a cheaper car than a Fusion, quite possibly - and I'm not the only one that thinks so - check out Intellichoice and Edmunds numbers. This logically the ultimate justification for those that go out and spend the extra money on a Camcord - but also one with a very solid historically supported foundation.Over the longer term, of course, that differential will always shrink in the cheaper car's favor and then we are all reduced to a bet of sorts - on the long term reliability and repair costs on one car vs the other, and again we can all point to 20 years or so of history versus a whole 2 as we all seek to make the best 'bet' we can. Folks that point to initial purchase price can sometimes justifiably point to some great discounted and/or mfgr sponsored 'deal' they think they got, but the fact of the matter is that initial purchase price is only one of several components of what it truly costs to own a car.

think about this for a second -while it is true that Ford has avoided dumping the Fusion thru the fleet sales depts., resale value market perceptions will always largely be governed by what people think the the brand name as a whole. Example - you are going out to buy your kid his/her first car, and you tell your neighbor that you bought an 6 year old Camcord with 100k on it. He nods because he understands. Tell him the same thing about a Contour in the same condition and he wonders if you are crazy. The fact that the 1 and 2 year old rental fleet Taurus can be bought for 10-12k or that they are floating 6 grand+ on Crown Vics can do nothing but hurt a Fusion's resale values, simply because the Taurus/CV are cheapening the brand name as a whole.It is perhaps unfair, but for the last 10 or 15 years at least - Toyotas and Hondas are assummed reliable and valuable while the 'Detroit' products are assummed 'suspect'. Ford (and Ford buyers) will have a long time to wait before this changes - even if the Fusion proves to be the most reliable and best car ever built. "

She said she only visited the Ford showroom after seeing Ford's great performance in the latest JD Power IQS ratings. Before she saw that she simply would not have considered a Ford product.I've also read about buyers who won't consider a Camry due to the engine sludge and transmission problems. I'd say the shoe is now firmly on the other foot. Diehard Toyota and Honda fans won't be swayed but the average buyer will be. "

Accord/Camry having stability control standard has no merit?? actually if you understand what stability control does and how it works, the fact that the Fusion doesn't even offer it is a big advantage -to the Fusion, under those controlled and specific conditions that Ford dictated the tests be conducted. Remember that we are talking about how much 'fun' it is to fling a few sedans around a test track here - not how ultimately safe they are.We've been thru this before, but your 'Challenge' remains about the biggest sham ever foisted on the car buying public. Ford should be ashamed to think that it has to resort to such things. "

""Sounds like GM's version of the Ford Challenge. Good for them.""No way, Ford challenge was a paid advertisment from Ford, while this is a gutsy move aimed at buyers in dealerships, not passersby. GM is definitely on move, the product they have launched in the past year of so has been far, far improved from the past (GMT900s, Saturns Aura-Vue-Sky, upcoming Malibu, CTS, Acadia, upcoming G8) and I don't see why it won't be successful. Ford on the other hand, well apart from the Fusion, there really is not much to talk about, I would have preferred if they had got some of the Euro fords here, which are excellent vehicles, including the small/micro cars, which would have been a great move, seeing how gas prices are skyrocketing here.

Example - you are going out to buy your kid his/her first car, and you tell your neighbor that you bought an 6 year old Camcord with 100k on it. He nods because he understands. Tell him the same thing about a Contour in the same condition and he wonders if you are crazy. Except you leave out that for the same money the camcord costs you can get two Contours. And why do I care what someone else thinks, anyway.I actually did buy two used contours that became teenager cars after I had used them myself for a while.

I have no 'disgust' for Ford products and have said several times that I thought that both the Fusion and 500 were well designed vehicles - disgust? - that probably happens when I evaluate what's under the hoods and drive them and is only a personal importance that I assign to drivetrain sophistication How much do you think Ford (or anybody else) PAYS the JD Powers' of the world to use their name for promotional purposes, BTW? Or for that matter, how much R&T or C&D were PAID for their 'participation' and name use in your ballyhooed Challenge? Those quality and safety awards you point to need to be earned and not necessarily bought.Trust somebody like CR to come out with something that tells me that the Fusion has been the least troublesome car in its class for at least the last 5 years or so - then, I become a 'believer'.

They would all have to be automatics because as far as I can tell, the XE model in the comparison doesn't come with a manual.I was playing around on the Saturn website and it appears that the base model XE is what is used in the comparison (based on price).

I won't lie, I have found the 4 cylinder engines on both the Camry (rented) and the Sonata (also rented) to be perfectly adequate...in a rented vehicle but when I am shelling out my own $$$ I want a V-6.

living in a closet? you really think that 99.99% of their income comes from these industry studies or that the cost of showing that picture of a trophy in an ad comes cheap? CR publishes exactly where their money comes from and how they use it and is non-profit, so how do you know anything is 99.99% of anything at JDP! A link would be appreciated. Objectivity is not something I question with something like CR although I don't agree with their priorities a lot of times, simply for the fact that no money changes hands. Anybody that is in it for that money - that would be a different story, don't you think? Last year's favorite over there at JDP was Hyundai if I remember correctly (another mfgr. in need of an image remake), and Honda/Toyota would not likely find any real benefit to advertising something that most folks already know and expect. CR currently rates the Accord and the Altima tops in this category overall with the Fulans in the middle of the pack - and does not allow either Honda or Nissan to advertise that fact - amazing how that works is it?

Cost to run a brand new domestic vehicle 65K miles = almost 5,000 dollars in repairs (not maintenance) and tow trucks (4 of them) outside of warranty.Cost to run a new Honda 65K miles = $0.00 outside of maintenance and gas. Zero tow trucks.Cost to run a new Audi to 19K miles = $0.00 outside of gas.

Interestingly enough, Aura's only available 4 cyl. Greenline is more expensive than their V6 XE base model.Saturn chose to compare their XE model, which is their cheapest, to a mid-range trimline in the Camry and Accord. To be honest, I'm not sure what models they are comparing to because they list two different prices on the Saturn pages.My best guess is that the Accord is the SE and the Camry is the LE with some options.

Why would I wanna do that when I can easily just put them into my minivan and still seat 5 people. Who puts all this junk in their car anyway? Get a truck.Well that's the point... with a hatchback, most of the time I don't need a truck. And since I don't want to pay for a truck nor the insurance for it, I don't have a place to put one, and wouldn't want to drive one unless I absolutely had to, it's great having a value added feature that helps me get more out of a midsize car than those who only have 4 doors and a trunk. To me, given that a hatch can look as good if not better than a sedan, it seems to me that the design of a sedan wastes a lot of space.Besides, this was not a planned pick up of these chairs. I was running through the office, and noticed all the office people with new chairs and these 3 month old ones sitting in the warehouse. If I didn't grab them then, they'd be gone. I'll post em on Craiglist, make a quick $150, and that's that. But if I drove a sedan, these chairs would be in a dumpster or someone else would have sold them. Plus with hatchbacks, you get to have all the stuff you'd normally have in the trunk and out of the way, right there in the car with you. No isolation. No thanks.You must be one of the Sopranos... no worries for me; no smelly dead bodies in my trunk. Either that or you keep too many things in your car. I'd hate to hear what it sounds like when you have to brake suddenly! "

""some also don't understand financing. Never has Honda or Toyota offer 0%, and very rarely 2.9%.. Financing costs also must be included in the price of the vehicle""It has been my experience that vehicles with 0% financing incentives take a hit in resale value that is equal to or even greater than the savings in finance charges. Think about it, if they have to use heavy incentives to sell a vehicle when new (I'm talking both about big customer cash rebates and 0% financing deals) then the car isn't likely to be in huge demand on the used market, either.

I didn't say that at all - another case of you jumping to conclusions. What I said was that JD Powers like some of these other survey companies, are indeed profit making organizations and do receive a fee for use of their name in advertising ventures - so therefore, any award that any mfgr. gets should be deemed suspect. So let's look at the situation as it exists today or it did a little while back when Hyundai 'garnered' a few of these awards, the mfgrs. that certainly need to tout their improved reliabilities etc. invariably end up receiving these awards and the ones that don't (and yes, Honda and Toyota would be good examples) don't. Amazing the way that works, isn't it?Money has power, doesn't it? As I said earlier, as soon as your Fusion starts winning anything from some organization that is NOT in it for the money, and statistically shows a LONG TERM improvement in the reliability, improves what they put under the hoods - then I take notice. All I can do is try to turn the lights on in your closet, though, I can't get you out of it.As far as your touted challenge goes, anything that is 'sponsored' or 'staged' by anybody that would stand to gain by the result is the most obvious opportunity to abuse what otherwise must be true. This kind of thing happens in a lot more than just car tests. Give me a properly selected population sample (probably out of the Orient) and I can find a whole bunch of 2 pack/day cigarette smokers that happened to all live into their 80s or 90s, thereby 'proving' my contention (I do, after all, work for the American Tobacco Institute) that smoking increases life spans, this after I conveniently ignore the fact that the Marlboro man died of lung cancer a while back. Ridiculous enough?How about if I worked for Ford and needed to come up with something that I could use to promote our new Fusion?Well, maybe the first thing I might do is go grab 'a random group' of folks that have been 'Ford families' for years, as you apparently are, wine and dine them, get them appropriate exposure to a good salesman, and then pick three cars that by any definition aren't equal and compare them under specific tests and conditions that are designed to accentuate the virtues of one vs. the others, while again conveniently ignoring those tests that don't. Ford (or anybody else) is NOT going to spend the money for a comparison like this without KNOWING what the results are at least likely to be. How far they actually went to insure it, beyond the specific models and test types selected, you and I both don't know. In any case, results of any sort of 'sponsored' event should be given zero creedence. And that would include 'comparisons' run by Honda and Toyota, if and when, they are reduced to such tactics. "

Not an issue. Most (if not all) hatches have a hard divider (like a parcel shelf) that divides the trunk area from the passenger area when the hatch is closed, and opens up with the hatch. It effectively seals off the trunk area, but is removable for the larger items.The ol' hatchback isn't what it used to be. It's more of a car with a proper trunk these days, but with a larger cargo capacity and much-larger (and easier, IMO) access. "

Lousiwei, you are wasting your time with this; everyone knows (including Scape deep inside) that this was an advertisment campaign, not a comparison test. Ford also calls it an avdt campaign that has worked for them, so its difficult to understand how Scape calls it a credible comparison. Since it is an advertisment, why would Ford include any parameters that the Fusion was not at the top in?You want comparisons, look for publications that do this for a living or look at real people buying these cars. CD and RT did not validate this advertisment as their opinion (as they wouldn't with any advertisment in their mags)....CD and RT have a lot of advertisments in their magazines, does that mean each of the advertisments is blessed as an opinion by them?

Good post, captain.AGAIN, the biggest problems with the Fusion Challenge (besides not being an objective comparison test) is that the questions were very limited in scope, and the survey respondants were NOT VOTING with their CHECK BOOKS.Why didn't they include questions on perceived quality? Comfort? Brand reputation / past experiences with the brand? Of course, they limited the survey to the questions they could win (handling with AWD and styling).The Fusion is a better handling car than the Accord. I also think it is an attractive car. If I had participated in the Fusion challenge, I probably would have voted the same way most of the other participants did. However, ask those same participants to evaluate the cars on ALL of aspects, and choose which one they would BUY for themselves, and suddenly the outcome changes. "

The publicity around the IQS awards should get more people to actually look at the Fusion and other Fords instead of blindly crossing them off the list.

Interesting article baggs. However, I didn't read in it more information about the design or methodology of the surveys. If they did collect and analyze more data, I never saw it published or advertised. The survey results I saw from Ford were short and overly simple. ""Did you like the handling (or styling, or driving feel, etc.) - Yes or No?""Ford admitted in the article you referenced that they discovered that people drove the Fusion and liked those attributes (handling, styling, etc), but still bought something else. So why would they focus only on those attributes? Why emphasize those in the Fusion challenge advertising? Winning those attributes alone aren't enough to overcome Honda and Toyota.They need to find out why people appreciate those attributes in the Fusion but still keep shopping (as I did). My guess is, if they did collect data on perceived quality and brand experience, they didn't like what they saw.Ford may be on the right track with the recent quality improvements- however, whether that will translate into better LONG-TERM reliability and higher future resale values remains to be seen.

I have found a lot of utility in having a class 1 or class 2 hitch installed on my vehicles. This has served me very well. The overwhelming majority of the time, if there is something connected, its a hitch mounted bike rack, and almost any car in this class will have no problems towing a 5x8 uHaul trailer or similar.I am a big fan of second hand furniture (I can't bring myself to drop $2k on contact-paper/veneer over pressboard when I can buy older real wood furniture for much less) and because most private sellers don't have a delivery service, I usually end up with a small utility trailer behind one of the cars. The Subie can tow 2700#s, and that towing capacity is more than the payload capacity of many SUVs, and when I am not towing, I get 30mpg. "

It's pretty obvious why they would not want to publish such data in an ad.However, I didn't read in it more information about the design or methodology of the surveys.I doubt the surveys were too complex. Probably 10-20 questions asking the basics. Anyone who looks at their published results in the ads, mainly the bar graphs, will notice that the Fusion didn't beat the Accord by much in the three categories they tout. Therefore I wonder if those are the only three categories it did win in. Perceived quality and reliability surely lost based on that article and I'd be curious to know what other questions they asked and what the results were.I'm a Ford guy and always have been so they don't need to convince me that their vehicles are competitive. But ads like the Fusion challenge and whatever they come up with for the latest IQS awards will certainly change some minds and if nothing else, plant a seed. They still need to provide water and sunlight for that seed to really change people's perceptions though. "

This should answer your questions and those by others regarding the Fusion and Aura challenges going on now.That link, Baggs32, was a very informative news story. We've owned our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion for about six months and have never been invited to participate in any survey.We are extremely satisfied with our purchase. The car has had zero problems, not so much as a single squeak or rattle. The fit and finish are perfect. Our only complaint is in-city gasoline mileage but even that is now approaching the revised EPA estimate of 17 mpg city.It's pretty obvious that this a forum dominated by Camcord supporters and that is OK, too. A difference of opinion makes the world go 'round. Camry and Accord are No. 1 and No. 2 in sales in the mid-size market but that does not mean that the new Fusion and new Aura are not worthy competitors. They certainly are, in my book.I think FoMoCo and GM are wise to adopt hood-to-hood advertising methods because smart mid-size sedan buyers should be well-informed before they make a choice. "

Financing only matters in the price of the vehicle if you are financing it.If it is discounted a lot, it can still matter to the (would be) cash buyer (such as myself). When I compared prices, if there was 0% financing that had a value equal to what I would earn in a tax exempt money market fund by taking the loan, rather than paying cash. Currently if I were buying a $20,000 car, 0% for 36 months would be worth maybe around $1200. "

A logical assumption, I think, that the new Accord will at least have to get up into the 270hp territory to match the Camry and Altima, anything much more than that may create a little torque steer overkill much like the TL-S. How could the new Accord 'blow away' the competition? How about a 170hp+, 350 lb. ft. high tech clean diesel that gets 30+ mpg EPA combined?

here's a few reasons to choose a Fusion over the Accord... the steering on the fusion is quicker and has more feel in comparison to the heavy feeling steering of the accord. the suspension and chassis on the fusion makes the car feel lighter and a bit more tossable, although the accord does have a good feeling chassis...it just feels heavier and less direct. and of course the brakes on the accord have been tested to be pretty lackluster and in some cases worst in class. personally, I'd rather have an engine that was a few tenths slower to 60 than 15 feet shorter to get back to 0 mph; at least in an emergency stop, the fusion would be more likely to avoid an accident. then of course, we could talk about the looks... personally I think the Fusion is pretty striking, and not too far out there like the Altima (at least the taillights) whereas the Accord is not offensive or anything, but isn't a standout either. AWD is another reason to like some versions of the Fusion... although I don't have AWD on my mazda6, I did have it on my Legacy and it was valuable in more than just bad weather. when driving at anything more than 20mph, grip and traction is always a good thing and anything that helps improve this can either be safer or more fun. And of course the recent reliability reports in consumer reports and jd powers seem to confirm that the Fusion is holding up amongst the best of all automobiles. These are all good reasons to consider the Fusion over any car. Would I buy one though? Nope, I'm quite happy with my Mazda6. "

Personaly, I consider reliability rating fairly worthless. I guess they may be a good guide, but they don't, and can't factor in how well somebody takes care of their car. You could even go as far as to say that part of the reliability problem for lower priced cars is that many of the people who buy them are less well off, and it's the most they can afford for a car. Lower income car buyers with less disposable income are far less likely to get all the proper maintanece performed on their car. Its akin to why vehicles that are ""dumped"" into fleet sales get lower reliability rating. the drivers dog the hell out of 'em. Its not that the car is inferior, It's that the drivers abuse them.To all those who ask, how will that fusion be in 10yrs, I know how my accord will be, I'd say1. I'd be willing to bet you an accord that a fusion (properly maintained) will have about the same amount of problems as any accord, camry, altima ect2. Honda is every bit as capable of screwing up as anyone else. Nissan (nor its customers) foresaw an engine problem in the fist month of 2006 production that would destroy sales of the sentra and altima for the entire year. (the sentra still hasn't recovered) It was that unexpected, (and uncommon with nissan) mistake that contributed the most to honda passing nissan in sales last year. "

I know that Honda will blow the doors off of the competition because that is exactly what they did in the fall/winter of 2002 when they introduced the 2003 model Accord. Lightyears ahead of the competition at the time. The 03 Accord was not light years ahead of the midsize competition, lets not forget the then new Altima was available, as was a new Camry. So at best the Accord was competitive, but not light years as you mention. "

If that ""1 extra problem"" means a breakdown/stranding or even an expensive out of warranty repair, that's a little more than a mole-hill, at least to me.Yes, but you assume more than you should. Where is the data that suggests that extra problem is one that would strand a person? There is some info on CR as to specific probs, but unfortunately I have not seen other sources supporting these findings. Given that CR pulls data only from a small unrepresentative sample of the population, I hesitate to read too much into their conlusions unless the differences are drastic (red dot vs black dot). And again, the differences between brands are minor over a five year period in most of these cars in this segment in problem areas that would leave a person stranded. And when it comes to probabilities of that one extra problem being minor (one that does not require emergency and immediate service) are far greater than the chances of having a major problem (since the amount of minor problems far exceed the amount of major problems that can happen in a car). So not only is your argument assuming the worst without citing any evidence to support your assumption, but it would also seem the odds of having a minor problem far exceed the chances of having a major problem. So yeah, it's still a mole-hill. "

Accords don't have options, they only have models. VP,LX,SE,EX,EX-L,EX-L-Nav, LX-V6,SE-V6,EX-V6,EX-V6-Nav,EX-V6-6spd Since it was a V6 Auto, it is an LXV6,SEV6, or EXV6.

I am not as familiar with Toyota's models and packages.The different models come with vast differences in equipment levels and prices.The differences in SE-V6 and EX-V6 are as night and day as LX 4-cyl and EX-L 4-cyl, and their $4,000 difference in MSRP reflects that. It isn't just minor stuff. it's leather, heated seats, auto climate control, black plastic trim vs. wood/alumininum trim, etc...I don't consider leather, heated seats, and auto climate control to be unlikely to be noticed, or ""minor,"" but that's just me.

However you and others blow by this tranny problem like it was nothing. Most recalls from Ford, GM, etc. result from small numbers of part failures so why didn't Honda recall their tranny too? IIRC the tranny failures weren't of the ""my car won't go in reverse"" nature, but rather the ""holy cow my wheels just locked up at 75 mph on the highway"" nature. Recalls can be voluntary and a lot are. Honda didn't do everyone a favor by extending the warranty. Only replacing those trannies would have made owners safer.

I'm not a huge fan of CR data either, but they have been on the money regarding where the problems were on most of my prior vehicles.Minor/major, I guess that is personal and relative. My last Ford had a transmission issue. At 9k they slapped a band-aid on it (still a pretty involved procedure) and said ""all fixed."" It wasn't any better. After that, they ""couldn't duplicate the problem."" When the warranty ran out at 36K I had the full transmission service done. Little help. So I checked the good 'ol Edmunds ""maintenance and repair"" forums and people were replacing trannies out of warranty. I'd probably have kept it if not for being worried about that and other issues. If I could have avoided that one problem by buying a different vehicle in the first place, it would have been worth it *to me.* We're not talking stranding, however several trips to dealer and eventual loss of faith in the vehicle out of warranty.

I hate slimy dealers!Actually, your net might have been a bit higher than you think, since it sounded like you would have financed the car anyway. So your net rebate would be based on the difference in the interest cost between the MAC loan and the loan you replaced it with. All three places I shopped at told me it could be paid off right away. OTOH, I did get hosed on the rate...10.5% for me, with a credit score around 800. Not that it mattered much, given the length of time I had the loan  .The dealer I bought from mentioned some places telling this 3 month story. The finance guy said no way would he do that because it is not worth getting in trouble with the state regulators.I have never seen another case where they gave a rebate only if you took a loan.

I can only imagine it might have taken the next owner at least another $10,000 dollars to get that car to 100K miles.If a car can't be driven agressively, (abused as you say) and still hold up, then it is a piece of junk. Plain and simple. Any high quality vehicle (like my 2003 Honda) can be driven as hard as you want w/o worry of any ""problems,"" granted, you should at least follow a reasonable maintenance schedule if your going to be driving it hard.Reliability and dependability ratings should not only be based on ""best case scenario"" maintenance and BABYING it type driving, but also ""minimum maintenance"" and VERY AGGRESIVE type driving. That is what matters, that is what counts, and that is the true test. Either way, there is no reason to believe that not maintaining vehicles (because low income people might not do it) would affect reliablity rankings in a way that would make them unreliable data. All car brands and all car models would be equally mis-maintained over a large sample size. Also, Mercedes/Chrysler have reached the bottom of the pit in reliability, and last I checked low income people don't buy them. Honda's and Toyota's are fairly economical, and they are at the top......Hmm....... "

I think the Fusion styling is unique, but bland. Wow, really. I don't care for the styling myself, but bland??? The excessive chrome grill is certainly not bland. I'm pretty sure if you look up the definition of that word, there is a picture of the current Accord there :P  .The best looking of these cars is clearly the Mazda6  . This is proven by Toyota's feeble attempt to copy some of its appearance features into the new Camry.The Altima is not appealing to me at all. The only thing the new design accomplishes is to make the previous version look not so bad. Maybe if they did something to make the rear end not look so ""heavy""... "

As for the Fusion making the Accord and Camry look ""frumpy"", park the Fusion next to an Aura, or Altima, or even the old Mazda6, and suddenly the Fusion looks pretty frumpy, in my eyes.I saw an Aura on the road today and I was reminded that it is a very slick looking car, especially the rear 3/4 view. Maybe because there is actually some sheet metal on the car, vs. all tailights and headlamps as on the Altima.  The Mazda6 is an old design now but I think it's worn well, especially the Special Value Edition available now with minimal ground effects, big alloys, and blacked-out lamps. "

The truth is, according to the data from JD Powers AND Consumer Reports, that the difference between cars in this category over a five year period is minimal, and the chances are that the problem that does occur is going to be minor which does not require immediate and emergency attention. So any talk about how much more reliable a certain car is without any verifiable statistics is baseless or at least anecdotal. Because the data that really does exist shows that the differences in reliability between cars in this class is quite small, and would probably surprise most buyers. I do understand your reluctance to trust a certain brand because of personal expererience... but working in electronics retail showed me that EVERY manufacturerer has problems so if every one of those customers with a bad experience means that brand was bad, well there would be no brands to buy. I will pay attention to blogs and forums to get a gauge of what areas are problematic, but I will always give more weight to studies that gather information from thousands of sources and not just one.

Furthermore, Ford, GM, and all other mfrs replace faulty parts under warranty. Why point out that Honda did too? It's not like they did anything any other mfr would have done. Incorrect!!!! You couldn't be more wrong. Dodge never offered to ante up for fixing my early death faulty tranny in my Dodge. Chrysler didn't come to the rescue either. In fact, when I asked the Dodge dealer why I had to keep coming back and why the car kept breaking down, the reply was, ""cars just breakdown, parts just break down."" So I was left out in the cold by Chrysler/Dodge. I will never buy an American vehicle again because of THAT tranny failure. The same thing happened to me again in my V6 Accord from 2003, but Honda stepped up and fixed it AFTER warranty technically expired. Not only did they pay to fix it, but they paid for the rental, ordered the new tranny assembly overnight shipping, and got me back on the road on Wednesday after taking the car in on Monday morning. I paid nothing. For the Dodge, I paid about $1,200 to fix it. I will buy a Honda again if I feel like it. I will never ever until hell freezes over and pigs fly on the same day buy a Chrysler made product.Honda stands behind their products, I have serious doubts about the Big 3. Heck, they might not even exist in 4 years when your tranny fails in that Ford, GM, or Chrysler product, what then, no one to go to for Warranty repairs! Think about that! They will go out of business and screw all of their customers in a heartbeat.Also, it didn't hurt that the Tranny issue was the ONLY mechanical issue in my Honda, meanwhile the Dodge had 100 problems mechanically, literally.

Oh Really?-You are aware that Honda's last gen. 3.5 engine, used in my neighbors Odyssey (and the reworked one is in my Pilot) was removed from the van as oil was not reaching a part of the engine. It was an engineering issue and req'd redesign. This was not publicized because Honda found the issue before it was reported. It req'd removing 22,000 Odyssey engines and shipping them for the work. -You are aware the last generation Acura MDX had transmission failure issues and so many brake failures that they faced recalls to change the master cylinder. The Civic has also had serious brake issues after 50,000 miles -You are aware that this generations Accord has had hundreds of thousands of center stack cluster failures (stereo units only).Consumers are seriously misled if they believe that a car manufacturer is bulletproof and their models are free from defect in engineering or design. Even the best manufacturers deal with recalls as they have to deal with part makers they outsource to. They also sometimes make mistakes in the engineering process. This is a fact: the level of quality between the best and worst manufacturer today is so small, in defects per 100 vehicles, that the over publication of 'quality' being owned by a few manufacturers is ridiculous. Do most people realize that we are talking about 1 problem (and that problem could be a seatbelt handle as in the Hyundai Sonata) per 100 vehicles between the best and worst.

My job involves visiting hundreds of repair shops, and meeting upwards of a thousand mechanics a year. I can quite confidently tell you that the majority of cars being fixed in garages are being fixed because they weren't properly maintained. and yes, I see plenty of hondas, and toyotas; along with every other make of car. The overwhelming number of engines replacements are done because the engine sludged up from lack of proper oil changes. the overwhelming number of radiator/head gasket repairs are made because the cooling system was never flushed. the vast majority of transmissions needing replaced/rebuilt are because they were never flushed. It is absolutely astonishing how people treat their cars. I couldn't count the number of times I've seen a radiator flushed and the water comes out brown with tiny peices of corrosion in it, or the number of times I've seen engines so sludged up that oil couldn't even be poured in because it couldn't drain down.

""cars shouldn't be any less reliable if they're driven hard.""Really? That's pretty comforting. I drive my cars pretty hard, but not what one might consider abuse. I never drop the clutch, always start cleanly then throttle it. I don't powershift. I usually shift up at 3k RPMs, sometimes 4, less often 5, and rarely redline, but I'm mostly into the throttle pretty good regardless of RPM. I often wonder if driving less enthusiastically would have a dramatic increase in the longevity of the vehicle. But that wouldn't be any fun! Besides, I can't be too bad as I still see EPA mileage, and at over 5,200 miles the Accord's ""maintenance minder"" is still showing 30% oil life left (apparently calculated based on accumulated engine revs). I always do the maintenance, full synthetic etc.What's everyone think? Do you typically drive your midsize sedan more like a sports sedan? If so, do you think it will affect long-term reliabilty? "

as long as your driving hard, and not abusing. Its like with a clutch, droping it isn't nearly as bad as driving with it half in, half out. That what kills them the fastest. Not saying its good to rev the engine to 5ooo rpm and then pop it, but I'd consider that abusive too. I think you might see a little more longevity (my speculation) if you were easier on it, but only because hard driving will tend to make a weak part give out. As where with easier driving, it might last a little longer.Oil is kind of funny, and very condition dependant. newer cars run much cleaner than cars of 10yrs ago. Couple that with much improved oil (the addatives) and it tends to stay cleaner a lot longer. someone driving primarily highway miles for moderate distances could very well go 5,6 or more thousand miles without an oil change. On the flip side, someone driving short distance, stop and go rush hour traffic would be making a huge mistake to change their oil any less than 3k. "

Plus, honestly, what's the cost of an oil change? $20? $30? It's not like one extra change or two per year is going to blow your bank account or anything.And it gives you better mileage and less wear as well, since there's less sludge and gunk circulating. Of course, I also put some oil stabilizer in as well, since the summers out here in CA/NV/etc are brutal and sap viscosity like a vacuum cleaner. Doubly so if it's an older car. And, yeah - even with a new car, 3K and the oil is dirty and full of gunk. Goes in almost clear and comes out the color of mud. Using that oil life sensor and going 5-6K between changes is what gets you the sludge. Trust your brain and not the gadget I say. "

Reving a warmed engine with good oil pressure isn't going to hurt anything, thats why the oil is there. Once it gets to proper temp, your pistons are gliding on sheet of warm oil. It is basically a zero wear environment. If an engine is never rev'd, the piston may go microscopically higher in the cylinder than it is used to, and the carbon deposits can build up in the cylinder walls and stop the piston or chip the piston ring. Either way, its not pretty but I haven't heard of a case of this on a modern engine with modern gas.Dropping the clutch isn't as hard on the clutch as riding it, but its harder on the rest of the drive-train and suspension components. Shock loading every gear and shaft in the system isn't particularly helpful. Just watch amateur drag night (racing, not cross-dressing) and watch for the broken drive shafts and transmissions and suspension components.You can use machinery, just try to have some respect for it and be mindful of what you are asking it to do.

Really? I'm underwhelmed with the 2.5. It's definitely just ok. Haven't driven the 3.5 but I'm would tend to believe it's more of the same with a bigger engine.The Legacy is the most useful car overall in this class. It has AWD, long cargo area, optional turbo. The only problem with it, is the cabin is a bit cramped for my tastes.Mazda to me is to small as a family sedan. In my area a lot of kids drive them, probably because they can be had for a song. "

Very nice pic of the Mazda6. Every time i see a Mazda6 i cant help but admire the incredible tight body panel fit on the vehicle. Im aware most modern sedans boast excellent fit and finish, but the 6 has been out for some time under the current design, which is aging quite well, still looks very sharp and athletic. Cant wait to see what Mazda has planned for the 08 model, im sure it will be a very sharp vehicle, as most of Mazda's current lineup is looking impressive. "

where all the Nissan Altima owners are?? when I'm not trying to tone down all the Fusion blog, that would be what I am ,a very satisfied purchaser of 3 Altimas and a Maxima, 2 older 4 bangers and an 03 3.5 (the Maxima had a 3.0). It is from Nissan that my personal bias towards great engines/drivetrains comes. Really like the new Altima but admit to finding the new CVT a little disconcerting. It is strange though that with as many as they sell, that we don't see some 'blog' on this car as well. It is certainly something that is 'blogable'. Don't know what the sales stats are in my area (Texas), but down here I seem to see more of them than Camcords! And yes, CR does have the new Altima tied for top spot in the fiercely competitive midsize sedan segment with the older Accord, but that may change with the new Accord due out in a few months.

Thanks! Yeah, every time I walk out to find my car in a parking lot, I think that it still looks really nice vs it's peers, even if it's a car designed 5 years ago. It just has a nice flow to it. I agree with backy who said that the newer mazda6's have a bit more of a refined look since they toned down some of the sharper ground effects, but it still has the typical muscular mazda curves. The 08 has me pretty excited too, especially hearing what they may do to bump up the power. I just hope they don't make it too big and make it feel too bloated and boat-ish. Right now, passenger space is perfectly adequate if just a bit snug, but the handling and balance is great for a passenger car. I spent 20 minutes riding in the back seat of a friend's mazda6, and I was perfectly comfortable with plenty of legroom and headroom. But I get the sense that with all the other cars in this class getting bigger, the dye has been cast for the 6 to maybe be a bit less sleek like it is now, and be a bit more muscular in the next gen.

You don't seem to understand. Honda sees ""Good Will"" repairs as an investment, in Repeat Customers.Going by that they should have replaced our driver's power window track 3 months after the warranty expired ($400+ out of our pocket), the shocks at 30k miles, the muffler at 35k miles, the clunking spring in the right rear (they never did ""reproduce"" that one to fix it) and several other electrical and poorly crafted items in our '96 Civic. But alas, they didn't. Maybe Civic owners aren't important enough for their ""good will""? The brake pads kept wearing out about every 12k miles no matter what kind we put on too. I understand that that's not necessarily their fault though. h, and the catalytic converter's heat shields both rusted off not long after the warranty wore off (the years came long before the miles) and their advise to us was ""not to park in grass or dry leaves"". I should have done just that and let the thing burn to the ground.I'd still buy another Honda, but I'll never put them up on a pedestal like the media and other folks do. "

I'm sure the ""good will"" depends on whether or not you bring the car to that dealer for maintenance, and the dealer service manager's willingness to work with you. The dealer will not just offer you good will service, you have to ask for consideration. If it's a common problem, you have a shot. I have not received a good will repair on my 2 Accords, but then I don't bring the car to the dealer for maintenance, and there was only one repair done at the dealer since I bought the first Accord in 91.

I have to agree...some elements of the Fusion don't sit well with me. I'm beginning to like the Milan better. The Fusion looks so 1990s to me...it's too boxy looking and the taillights are Altima-like but not nearly as cool looking. Folks like to knock the Camcords but the Fusion offers nothing compelling outside of it's three bar grille, Caddy/Nissan styled headlights and clear taillamps in the back. I don't think there is an ""original"" design in this class of car because even the Altima got it's roofline from the Passat, but the Altima love it or leave it...is one of the few somewhat distinctive sedans in its class. The Mazda6 is probably the only other distinctive looking one. I do feel that the new Altima played it too safe though. Even the alloy wheels on the 07s resemble the previous Altima's alloys too much and from the sides the 17s on the SE models look like 15s. And especiallly from the sides, the Altima looks hatchback-like this time around because of the high designed trunk and taillights that stick out at on the sides. Nissan should upgrade and make 17s standard and 18s SE/SL exclusives. The Altima has always been my choice style-wise (and my opinions are subjective) but its always been the Accord that I thought was the best. Nissan brought some neat technology to the table this time around Bluetooth (Toyota did that first) push start standard, optional rear view camera, xenons (the prev. gen had those) etc. etc. I hope the Accord has some of those features and more..and keeps some features that the Altima still lacks (power passenger's seat) and maybe adds some things (power pedals, rain sensing wipers.I actually think the Accord will have a nice front end this time around from what we have seen, I like the sides too. Just hope the rear looks decent. I'm just sad that it seems the V6/6spd combo won't be available this time around. "

the redesigned Altima has taken bold and distinctive to a whole new level.the same could be said when the Altima first became truly competitive in this segment - back in 2002. A car largely responsible for Nissan's turnaround , that I think eventually got all the way up to 4th or 5th in sales numbers and the first to use a truly awesome V6 under the hood thereby forcing Honda and Toyota to respond. The new one takes the 'spirit' of the 2002 model to the next level, IMO , so if you didn't like the first one you are not likely to have much use for the new one. Establishing an identity I guess. As you say - different strokes. I do agree also that the Fulan's taillights and rear end is too high, but I definitely would prefer the Milan to the Fusion - if for no other reason than the 'in your face' razor blades. If this is Ford's new 'identity', I will leave them alone even if they do update the powertrains - the 500 was a better looking car, IMO than the regurgitated Taurus. The 6 is much better overall styling wise, IMO, but it also looks and apparently is SMALL. The Camry is certainly something really adventurous and is either love it or hate it (an unusual chance for Toyota to take), even at 4 years old the Accord still looks good to me, the Aura looks good although also plagued with a too high rear end, and the Sonata seems a hodgepodge of borrowed elements from both the Accord, old Camry, and the Lexus'.

After I got my Sonata 2 years ago, I started noticing more of them (and various other Hyundai's) than before. A big factor is also the length of time a model has been selling well. Accord & Camry have been established for many years while Sonata is a relatively new kid on the block. There's a lot more 10-12 year old Accords and Camry's around (which adds to the Accord/Camry population) than 10-12 year old Sonata's. The gap of 5 year old (or less) models has narrowed in my area, I think. It's hard to quantify because driving the same route at roughly the same time of day, I see mostly the same cars on a schedule similar to mine. I'm also seeing more Azera's on the road, which may just be a function of that model being out for almost 2 years. "

While the CamCords have changed in appearance, I think it's still easy to recognize (link) a 10 to 12 year old CamCord compared to the current model (but maybe not the '07 Camry). "

I've been hearing rumors that it's supposed to be a bit more sporty than the sedan w/ a firmer suspension and tweaked engine. If they go with the great 6-speed manual as they have in the current gen, it sounds like it'll be quite fun.

Yea the Veracruz is a looker, but that Santa Fe seems a bit bloated. Both better looking than the Sonata. Redo the front end, rework the dash, fix the below average driver's seat.

Where do the next gen Accord and Sonata share looks outside of maybe the front end? Which is a design that Honda ALWAYS used before the current Genereation Accord. The only resemblances I can see are maybe the front grille. Accords have always had long horizontal styled headlights up front. Even the Euro Accord aka the TSX continues that trend. So it would seem that the element of front end styling is something Hyundai stole from Honda.The rear end o the next Accord looks nothing like the Sonata, the sides definitely dont. I could see if someone said the next Accord favored the BMW 5Series, but the Sonata? I don't see it. Please explain. "

Camcords have passed that test.An excellent point, Goodegg, but the journey to five-year reliability has to start with the first step and the Fusion, at least, is off to a very good start, two years without major problems or recalls of any sort.As a proud Fusion owner, I sure hope this trend continues and the Fusions remain trouble free. Yup, the Camcords do have an enviable record, one that will be difficult, maybe, to equal. At least FoMoCo has started off on the right footing with the Fusion. "

For some, 5 year reliability may be a good test. However, my personal test is 10+ years under normal driving conditions. I generally keep my new cars for 12 to 15 years, and have three cars that rotate through that schedule. However, I still have an '85 SAAB 900 4-door sedan that I purchased in April of 1985 that's still going strong, both from an exterior and interior aesthetic point-of-view, and mechanically as well. Even the carpet floor mats are still in excellent condition, and this is with well over a quarter of a million miles. Except for normal wear and tear items, it's only had 1 clutch replacement, and absolutely no other work on the engine or 5-speed manual transmission. It does leak a few drops of oil, but doesn't use any between 3K changes. Others, their ""mileage"" certainly may vary, but this has been one rugged and reliable machine for over 22 years. "

As some of my Midsize sedans buddies know, I got hit last week in my 1996 Accord. Well, a few little gremlins have reared their ugly heads since the wreck in that car. I was driving it to work daily, until I realized my interior lights had stopped working in conjunction with my headlights (no gauges lit up, no A/C controls, my clock didn't get dimmer, etc...)Then two evenings ago, I realized the taillights were not illuminating either. The brakelights still work, but now, the only things working ""light-wise"" are both high-beams, the driver side low-beam, and the blinkers. The parking light on the driver's side has decided to quit working, as well.My estimate for repair was just over $1,200, by the way. I don't care if it is high or low - the other driver who caused the accident had insurance, which is footing the bill. "

I haven't seen bumper covers ""refinished"" before (which mean repainted). Any gouges will remain visible, they'll just be painted over.

 Nothing is actually dented other than the quarter panel, and I'm getting a new one of those.

For some, 5 year reliability may be a good test. However, my personal test is 10+ years under normal driving conditions.I'd have to agree that expecting 5+ years of reliable service is what I would expect when buying a new car, but I can't see where I could make the assumption that since I, or someone else I knew, had a reliable 10 year old car that the same make and/or model would necessarily be just as reliable. First, I don't know of any 10 year reliability date to use so coming up with decent data to draw any conclusions from would be difficult. Second, every new model with substantial changes from previous generations usually will have unique strengths and weaknesses that are sometimes impossible to forsee until lots of time goes by. Just because a ten year old ford had a good 3 speed automatic tranny, has nothing to do with whether the current gen 6 speed automatic will be as good.Third, companies change. Mercedes used to make very solid cars. While they seem to be improving from the recent woes lately, they were having some quality probs for several years. And Hyundai... changes as extreme as what they have been able to do in just a few years (granted, drawing a firm conclusion may still be a tiny bit premature), just goes to show how quickly a company can improve. While I understand what you're saying...some manufacturers have a long track record of consistently making automobiles that rank high for reliability over a 5 year period (which I think is the longest period for which reliability is tracked by major organizations - plz correct me if I'm wrong here). But the trend over the last 10 years has been one of increasing quality by the vast majority of manufacturers to the point where the difference is often less than a single problem over a five year period. This is the great thing about buying a car now... for the most part, a person can focus on things like ride quality, funtionality, style, or whatever that is important to them without getting overly obsessed with manufacturing quality. Instead of making just a ""safe"" choice and compromising on what they really want, buyers of midsize sedans can now safely make a choice that better reflects their desires and personality. I'm not saying don't do your research, but at the same time, don't put too much weight in colored circles without knowing exactly what those colored cirles mean and the numbers they actually represent.

Subaru Legacy and Mazda6 are the closest you'll get but they are just above average performers and neither are American. My recommendation is to check out the upcoming 2008 CTS, which looks very promising and should be reasonably priced (expect to pay 3-series+ price for a 5-series type of car). Another alternative is the refreshed 2008 STS. The cosmetic changes have made the exterior more aggressive and interior more pleasant to look at.

a dumb question - why would you possibly even want to get out of your M45? One of the finest sedans out there. It can't be that old. The logical suggestion amoong the American branded is the STS (or CTS) if you've grown accustomed to the bling, Caddy styling is definitely love it or leave it, but there is also the Lincoln MKZ with a better engine in it than the Fulan/6. Don't think any of the three will have the dynamic qualities of your M, however and also don't believe that the FE savings would amount to much if you put a pencil to it.

If it was out of warranty then they had no reason to.

That's why your Honda transmission was replaced. Dodge's trannies didn't last significantly longer than Honda's transmissions, I can assure you of that! My Honda was most definitely out of warranty, having 42,000 miles before problems surfaced. It was a 3 year 36K powertrain warranty back then. They stepped right up to fix it. Why? Embarrassment, character, integrity, honesty, sense of fairness, and wanting me to remain a customer; forward thinking!Dodge's auto tranny problems were early failures, and happened in numerous cases, same thing as Honda.

Dodge's auto tranny problems were early failures, and happened in numerous cases, same thing as Honda. Just a different response. Honda: we'll fix it, we'll extend warranties, we'll cover you. Dodge: parts just break down, cars just break down, tough luck! I'm pretty sure Honda's transmission failures were being looked into by the NHTSA though, simply because of the nature of the failures. One thing Honda seems to do well is avoid recalls by taking action before a recall is issued if they can. I think these transmission issues were a perfect example of that.IIRC the Honda failures in the Accord and other models induced wheel lock regardless of where you were or what speed you were travelling at. That's not so safe if you're on the highway. :surprise: If the NHTSA deemed the vehicles safe enough that Honda could get away with an extended warranty rather than a recall then I have no problem with that. Just don't believe that Honda or any other company is out to help you out. They had their best interest in mind, with the tranny situation and all the others as well, as a profitable business and you can take that to the bank.I knew three other '97 or '98 Civic owners who bought theirs shortly after we bought our '96 and all of them had problems with the driver's side window and the exhaust system. Each part failed like clockwork. It was rather interesting to be able to predict their problems and see them just shrug them off like I was crazy. They were known issues to all forum regulars so why didn't Honda step up there? Do they sell so many Accords that they didn't care which mid-sized vehicle we stepped up to? "

Just total loss of power when accelerating while at speed (it would happen at times, and never from a stop), so like power dips to zero, and in 2-3 seconds it comes back, so it was disconcerting and rather dangerous (since you're typically accelerating when you need to).

""Are we done with this yet. Does anyone still doubt me?""Not quite. Out of the millions and millions of cars sold by Honda, there is no way 100% satisfaction can be achieved. No manufacturer will have 100% satisfaction, you can always find one consumer who thinks they were wronged in some way.I'm of the opinion also that Honda generally stands by it's products, from what I've seen in the past. That item is now four years old, if that complaint was registered this year, I think it is a fair deal on both sides, considering the vehicle is four years old. At least, unlike a similiar Ford issue, Honda did not say: ""Nothing I can do"". "

There are Ford dealers that don't say that. Ford sells a LOT more vehicles than Honda and has a lot more dealers than they do. Obviously you are going to hear more complaints for Ford but I think most dealer satisfaction surveys show that Ford dealers are better. All mfrs pay for repairs out of warranty if pursued to do so in the right way by the right people. That's where a great dealer comes in. All mfrs also extend warranties on common problems like the Accord for Honda and the Focus for Ford for example. It is very misleading to someone who reads this thread looking for advise because they might be led to believe that Honda will fix anything for them at any time during the life of the car if they buy one. That's plain false. It's case by case and that's for any mfr. "

Here's the link to the pics of the interior. You get to the other two by following the link in the update from June 15th. Looks like the inside of the MDX and RDX but with fewer buttons which is a good thing. However, the buttons in this Accord are all still of similar shape and size which takes your eyes off of the road. Will it have climate and audio controls on the wheel like the Fusion? That would help the sea of buttons issue at least.I think you asked if that was a 6-speed zzzoom6? It's not according to TOV because this is apparently an I4 sedan. Still only 5 gears for that engine. I'd guess the V6 will still have 6 gears though. "

Furthermore, I believe people might try to take advantage of recalls by claiming their own ""at fault"" accident was really caused by some ""mechanical glitch."" There is overwhelming reason and motivation to blame the accident on something else other than driver error.Either way.... I had the jet installed at around 32K, and the tranny still failed at 42K, and they paid for a brand new tranny and the labor, and the rental, and did it in 2 days. The Honda dealer hooked up the rental and doing it quickly. AMerican HONDA hooked up the new tranny and paying for the labor, all the while extending the warranty to cover it. That was a Honda representatives decision, independent from my dealer. The dealer may have put in a good word for me... but ultimately it was not the dealer's decision.What was strange is they told me the tranny looked as good as new during the inspection.... yet it failed 10K miles later. I have a feeling the recall decision to put in a jet was knowingly done because it might work on 90% of the cars with problems. They knew the other 10% would need complete replacements later. But thats cheaper than replacing all 100% to begin with. "

Heard a funny story yesterday about a Honda Accord that got stolen twice in the same day and incredibly they caught both thieves! The funnier thing is that the first Accord thief drew attention to himself by racing another Accord that got away, but after running the plates, it too was a stolen car!!Same Honda stolen twice in one dayNever thought about it much when I had my two Accords, but both of them were broken into. My Subie never got touched, even when I left my door open at a Home Depot (one of my not so good moments :confuse: ). It appears that the Accord along with the Camry are among the most stolen, though the years of these models is pretty old. I remember once when I left my keys in my Accord, I was amazed at how easily the AAA person was able to unlock it. Given how many of these cars are on the road, I would imagine more poplular cars would be more likely to get stolen. And unless the thief does something really dumb to draw attention to themselves, it would be harder to track down a stolen accord or camry since they are everywhere. Anyway, just a thought... "

Honda has a certain reputation as do the other mfrs. But based on those reps we can't just assume that everything is always peachy when dealing with the former, and everything is a nightmare when dealing with some of the latter mfrs. I feel everyone has the right to buy the best vehicle for them. What makes them happy if you will.

While salivating about the new Accord, let's not forget about a couple of other important debuts coming soon to a dealer near you: Malibu, and Mazda6. I am actually looking forward more to the new Mazda6 than the Accord. Accord is predictable: a little more refined version of what we've seen before, with some nips and tucks. The new Mazda6 appears to be a significant styling departure from the old car, much larger, with much more power under the hood. Hopefully Mazda won't forget the zoom zoom. Malibu is interesting because it will tell us if GM can continue on their upward path in family sedans, which they started with the Aura. "

What concerns me about Mazda is that they aren't always consistent...They give us the 3, a GREAT runner up to the Protege, and then throw the Tribute at us. The 626 was a dullard, and the 6 was great, but the Mazda5 is the answer to a question nobody asked (underpowered station wagon with sliding doors).I dunno, but I don't just ""count on"" the next 6 being a big hit like the current Mazda 3 is. On the other hand, Honda has found a winning formula and sticks fairly close to it each time. While it doesn't make for a super-exciting release, it does make me look forward to what technological advancements will come to one-up the competition (A-Vtec for one). "

one thing to keep in mind about the likely bigger and heavier Mazda6, the current MazdaSpeed6 is a few hundred pounds heavier than the standard 6, but still handles very well. Granted, AWD is probably increasing grip around corners, but still, the Speed6 carries it's extra heft quite nicely both in terms of handling and comfort. Even with the CX7 and CX9, mazda has been getting props for handling compared to their peers, so I don't doubt that Mazda's engineers know how to keep a heavier car under control and in balance. When it comes down to it, I seriously doubt mazda would make the new 6 be the heaviest in this class regardless of what it wants to do to make the 6 more appealing to a larger segment. But as grad mentioned, I think there's an outside chance that mazda might soften the 6. In the end though, the direction mazda is heading toward is an identity that embraces passionate driving. I have a feeling the 6 will be working toward finding the balance and composure of a 3-series bmw while being more family-friendly. If mazda can keep the fun and functionality in the family daily driver like I think they currently have in the Mazda6 while giving it a bit more space and power, it could be a great thing. Actually, I think Mazda's biggest challenge is how to market a sporty midsize car... too many prospective buyers in this segment would probably be turned off by performance oriented sedan since most of the public views performance and comfort/practicality as being mutually exclusive. Mazda needs to find a way to say to buyers in this segment in a convincing manner, ""You can have it all."" To me, that's the brilliance of BMW's marketing... they've tied performance with the other traits of luxury, comfort, and refinement together in a very appealing and desireable product. Zoom-zoom speaks too much to youthful exuberance when most of the buyers of midsize cars are looking for something more refined and mature. the 6 already is a great product (of course I think this...which is why I bought one), I just think they need to adjust their marketing to reach the audience that actually buys these midsizers.

 Hard to do, but I think the nose of the '09 is worse than on the current Fusion. Too much chrome for my taste. The rear looks OK although only the chrome stick-on on the trunk (oh, let's stick some chrome on there too!) keeps it looking like many, many other cars (Daewoos come to mind). "

They give us the 3, a GREAT runner up to the Protege, and then throw the Tribute at us.That's Fords fault. Mazda doesn't have their own resources to create an ""entry-level"" SUV, and Ford simply dropped the ball with the revised Escape/Tribute.Besides, both the CX-7 and CX-9 has been very popular with the car mags, and I've heard nothing but positive comments from new owners. ...but the Mazda5 is the answer to a question nobody asked (underpowered station wagon with sliding doors). Mazda never expected for the 5 to be a big seller, since their intention from the beginning was to import a small amount of them. Despite that, I've seen a bunch of them on the roads, and the local dealer always seems to sell what few 5s they keep on the lot.I dunno, but I don't just ""count on"" the next 6 being a big hit like the current Mazda 3 is. On the other hand, Honda has found a winning formula and sticks fairly close to it each time.The next 6 should be a winner for Mazda, since a majority of the midsize sedan buyers didn't like the more compact dimensions of the current 6. It'll work if Mazda keeps the ""zoom-zoom"" (the philosophy, not the ad campaign  ).I don't expect the next Accord to be a dud either. In fact, I'm sure that it'll test and sell well. It just doesn't exactly stir up any excitement or emotion for me (and other enthusiasts, I'm sure). That's not a shot against the Accord, just my opinion. "

To my taste, that '09 Fusion would be an improvement. It loses lower section of chrome grill and the headlights are more staying in front plane of the car...I don't like the stretching back headlight look and the less chrome the better. The tailights are better too. The rear deck looks like it is maybe a little less high than the current one, if so that would be good.I don't care for the Malibu-ish chunk of chrome on the trunk lid or the chromey fog lights. "

I didn't mean to sound offended, I just realized it wasn't clear when I read my original post. I kind of go back and forth on it, it seems like all the OEMs do that. The Jetta used to be a fun funky compact car and now its big and eh, not as exciting as the previous generations. I used to think the 99 to 05(?) Jettas were cool with the 1.8t, now not as much. The early 90s Accord felt very athletic and was fun to drive, the current one, not as much. That doesn't mean all is lost, it is cyclical, especially with certain OEMs. The 80s Jetta was cool at the time, the early '00 Jetta was cool, but the 90s was not kind to VW. The early 90s Mazda 626 was cool, the next (mid 90s to early 00s)model lost its edge, and then they came back with the Mazda6.I think Car and Drive does a hits and misses issue every so often, I think they pick up on this cycle.

No reason mid-sized cars need to be merely a transportation appliance.Couldn't agree with you more! Driving doesn't have to be a chore... to me it's one of the few times during my workdays where I can have moments of exhilaration even when driving within the limits of the law. Of course I love the fact that I can run up to Home Depot and fit some items into my Mazda6 hatchback that would never fit in a sedan and be able to drive home gently without breaking anything. I do think zoom-zoom has done a lot to get Mazda more recognized, and it does sum up their core philosophy well. It is after all, one of the most recognized phrases that's associated with a brand and Mazda would be foolish to abandon it. But the Mazda6 is so much more than zoomx2; it would sell much better imo if they would emphasize its practical side more along with it's innovative features (ie: hatchback w/ spring loaded rear seats, v-6 w/ mtx, speed adjusted volume for the radio). Midsize buyers want more than just fluff and fun emotions or else they'd be buying a sports car or a compact. I'm sure there's a way for Mazda to mix fun and zoomx2 w/ something more practical and useful. "

here we go again... this will be the third discussion about the duratec 3.0 that has been in this thread lol.zoomx2 is much more than straight line speed (though the Mazda6 v-6 w/ a mtx has been tested to do 0-60 in the mid 6's). It's about balance, responsiveness, and handling. It's about being able to go around corners with confidence and a car that grips the road ""tenaciously"" as some car reviewers have put it. It's about having among the best brakes in this segment which allows for late braking into corners or avoiding bad drivers. But most of all, zoom-zoom is about having a bigger smile getting out of your car than when you got in it. and fyi...there's only been one generation of the mazda6 and it is current. "

626/6 same thing..... :P Anyway, wouldn't the zoomzoom be a bigger ZOOM if the 3.0 were taken out and the turbocharged 2.3 from the speed3 were put in? You'd get more horsepower and torque, and you'd lighten the car, especially on the front end. Sounds like a win-win ZOOM ZOOM scenario to me!I absolutely agree that the fun in driving a car does come from taking the twisties faster, and being able to, and being able to w/o stressing the car too much. The confidence you feel when you drive and are planted and railed to the road. However, all of this, should come with a powerful motor, so you can accelerate quickly out of those sharp corners, or have some fun in a straight line too. 200HP + 200lb/ft of torque works quite well for this if you can keep it at 3,300 lbs or under. The A3 is the perfect example and Audi's best brain child to date. However, the A3's 200 horses feel like 230 or so, and the 207 lb/ft of torque comes on at 1800 RPM, I don't even have to look up the 3.0 Duratec stats to know it doesn't match those figures at that low in the RPM scale. All this, and a 2.0 is a lot lighter and better balanced setup than a big hulking 3.0 V6. Come on..... admit it.... you'd exchange that Duratec for the 3.0 Honda V6 244 HP master engine in a heartbeat if you could. If you gotta go up to a 3.0 V6, you gotta go 240 HP +. "

Come on..... admit it.... you'd exchange that Duratec for the 3.0 Honda V6 244 HP master engine in a heartbeat if you could. If you gotta go up to a 3.0 V6, you gotta go 240 HP +.But I wouldn't take the Honda engine if I had to deal with their suspension, steering, and especially their weak brakes. Do I think the Mazda6 would be better with a more powerful engine? Yeah, the Mazdaspeed6 is an amazing car that I'd love to have. And even though it weighs a couple hundred pounds more, it still handles amazing. One more thing...what would an extra 30 HP do for this car anyway? Well, a cold air intake adds about 15 wheel HP to the 6, and maybe shaves 2 tenths off the 0-60 times if I remember correctly. Not a big deal.But after driving that car for around curvy roads I know well, I didn't feel bad about getting back into my car. For one, my car is paid for. But more importantly, I really like my car. I like how it looks, love the way it drives, I'm still amazed at how much stuff I can put in the back of a hatchback. And it is plenty fast. The duratec, though not the best or most powerful in this class, is still really good; it's smooth, sounds great when revved up and it loves to rev. And keeping the rpm's up above 2.7k rpm where it starts to pull pretty well is easy to do if you want to keep the car motivated. One thing I like about the duratec more than legacy GT or MS6 motors is that the power comes on in more of a linear way that is more predictable which is especially valuable in traffic. Now I love honda. I've had great experiences with their cars and power equipment for many years, and I follow what Honda does closely (from solar panels, to the innovative way they save $ on cooling their factory in summer, their jet plane, new diesel, their robot, F1 racing, CART and IRL etc etc) because I respect and admire much of what they do. But at this point in time with the choices that are available today, I would get a Mazda6 for the same amount of money as an Accord in a heartbeat. To me it looks better, drives better, holds more, is just as safe, and has more personality. "

Don't get me wrong... I don't think the steering and handling of the Accord is bad. In fact I think it's among the best in this segment. But for the way I like to drive, I think the mazda6 has less body lean than the accord and the steering feel seems to be a bit more direct and has a bit more feel. But the brakes on the Accord are a bit soft, one criticism that I also have for the Legacy. I've seen in several comparo's where the Accord had among the highest brake distances from 60-0. Having a Legacy in the past with not so stellar brakes, it's easy to compensate by giving enough distance to the car in front, but you never know when that 15 feet might make a difference. The Accord was on my short list of cars I was going to buy... but after doing the research to see what the percentage difference in reliability between the Mazda6 and the Accord and it being just a couple percent difference over a five year period, I came to the conclusion that I'd rather have the more responsive car that could haul more (I had owned an Accord hatchback and a Legacy wagon previously and found it really handy to have that big of an opening in the back to put bigger things in there). So bottom line, the Accord is a great value and an awesome car...but for me the Mazda6 got my pick. "

If you look at the center stack of the new Escape or that of the Flex that might give you an idea of which way Ford is going with their interiors. Definitely an improvement but not the greatest IMO.Engine choices will supposedly be the PIP Duratec30 I mentioned a month or two ago which is supposed to have 244 HP and get ""considerably better gas mileage than the new D35"", which gets better mileage than the current D30 already, according to the source from Ford. Choice #2 will be a new 2.5L I4 making 190 HP, and again, ""making considerably better mileage..."". Choice 3, and these next two are what I've heard little about elsewhere, a 260+ HP DI 2.5L Turbo I4 which should get better fuel econ than the V6. Choice 4: a full hybrid, call it Ford's gen II hybrid system if you will. Different from the current Escape's gen I system.The Escape will supposedly get Choices 1, 2, and 4 in '09 as well FWIW.Pretty interesting I think. Especially the turbo I4 if that is in fact true.

I've always wondered if Ford would leave the Fusion as-is for far too long, letting it fall further and further behind as the competition improves.I think it was last year or the year before that they vowed to ""refresh"" every model each year or two with total re-designs every 5 or 6 years. Probably to keep in line with the competition I'd guess.No official confirmation has been made on the next Mazda6 engine yet but it has been confirmed to debut at Frankfurt this year. Most of the info I've gathered lists the NA 2.5L I4 and a Mazda exclusive version of the Duratec35 as the engine choices. The other engine that popped up, rumor as of now, was not the DI turbo 2.5L but rather a DI Duratec37 making 300 HP. MAZDASPEED maybe? :surprise: It will be interesting to see what they do as I think the 3.7L was confirmed for the CX-9 already.Wow, those engine choices are pretty exciting.The V6, which is the big seller in the Fusion right now, is probably the least exciting but it is still pretty good news. Especially if they can and do offer the more fuel efficient, probably in a limited production performance edition of course, turbo DI I4. Maybe SVT will rise again soon. :shades: "

that does sound like a promising develpment. but I wonder why they would have a 244hp and 260hp options...they seem a bit too close together power wise. perhaps the turbo would have more torque at lower rpms than the v-6 (minus the lag of course)? or maybe they just want to take the Mazdaspeed6 powertrain and drop it in the fusion?

I'm not sure either. Seems to me the 2.5L turbo would have more than 260 HP though. Probably closer to 280 IMO. They could put that on AWD models, stiffen the chassis and suspension and call it an SVT very easily. Then sell it for $28k-$30k and make every Accord and Camry V6 stare at it's tail lights. :P "

I gotta say though, now that Honda has started to introduce cars with turbo's, it will be interesting to see what they do in the next few years. I'm thinking though, for the immediate future, turbo's will be an Acura thing with maybe one for an s2k replacement. As for the Accord, I doubt Honda will want to go for the fringe ""sporty"" market with the mainstream sedans. I could see a coupe that gets an ""s"" type treatment though with a firmer suspension, 6 spd manual, extra power, and maybe even SHawd or mugen treatments. That's what I'm hoping for actually... that could be an amazing car. The great thing with this step is that it could attract a whole new customer group (sport oriented) without alienating its core customer while adding some charisma to the Honda name, much like the Civic SI has done. But in the end, I think Honda would be concerned about poaching sales away from Acura, so I'm not holding my breath. Mazda, on the other hand, has shown it wants to own the fun-to-drive-without-bmw-payments segment and not worry about competition with sister companies. But I think their concern is that the 6 does not go to far out there where it's appeal is too limited and result in huge discounts like there are now. Really, I think all that Mazda needs to do for a successful new generation of the 6 is to make it a little larger and give it a bit more sound dampening at highway speeds while retaining fun to drive character. And more power as is being speculated would be :shades: :shades: :shades: "

The 6s limitations in my mind all have to do with those Ford imposed restrictions under the hoods. What exactly are these ""restrictions""? Consider that the 2.3L 4-cyl is a Mazda-designed engine that Ford uses in their products, and NOT vice-versa. As for the V6, Mazda didn't have the capital on their own to develop one from the ground up back in '01-'02, especially considering that the V6 is only offered in the US and Canada, and not in other markets.

What exactly are these ""restrictions""? That's something I'd like to know too. Without Ford I doubt we'd even be talking about a Mazda vehicle right now.Mazda has been given free reign over chassis development as well. The 6, RX-8, CX-9, and CX-7 are unique to them too. Ford has taken their platforms and done their thing with them but Mazda did do all of the ground work. This next 6 is not a re-badged Fusion and from what I've gathered actually shares more with the Euro Mondeo or vice versa.The 3, Tribute, and Mazda5 were all done jointly (3 and 5 included Volvo too) but I don't think Mazda was restricted in any way during their share of the development. I'm also wondering what the ""limitations"" captain2 referred to are as well. The 6s is competitive or class leading in all performance categories.

The only one I'm not quite sure of is the 0-60 because it was clocked at 6.5 seconds but the Accord may have been a tenth or two faster. Now it's a bit slower than two or three other sedans, but that will most likely be addressed with the next one. You keep harping on the Duratec30 like it's some dinosaur.

Right, true handling improvement means the vehicle is able to go around a corner faster, something that is hard to do with ESC applying brakes. As you said, adding power (in the right amount and to the right contact patch) is a good way to do that.Obviously, we are talking about professional driving. A wannabe (like me) would probably go around a corner faster with ESC than without, due to lack of experience in reaching the absolute limit of handling capabilities without losing control. This is assuming that the ESC is minimally invasive, meaning it allows some fun and only steps in when really needed. "

There was noise but it was from the exhaust which was given a sport tune to sound throatier. I liked that sound but others could be put off by it. I have also driven my father's old '96 Sable and his current '06 Zephyr. The Sable's DT30 was a bit rough by today's standards but the Zephyr wasn't all that bad. Better sound insulation might have helped the latter. I'd have to say the DT30 in the 6 is still the smoothest of them all though. And it had almost no sound insulation IMO.Keep in mind that I can't hear myself think in my Mustang when accelerating. Just so you have an idea of my sound tolerance.

And yes I owned several of those older Mazda/Ford products I referenced (an RX2, an 808, a Probe (a Mazda design originally intended to be a Mustang), and a GLC) and thought they were among the most underrated vehicles of that time - but then again, that was largely before the Ford infection hit the engine compartments. Put the Honda V6, the Nissan VQ, the Toyota 2GR, the GM 3.6, or the Kia/Hyundia 3.3s in a 6 (or a Fusion) then you would really have something IMO.

Electronic Stability Control (ESC) allows ABS systems to automatically brake individual wheels as needed to improve handling and steering control under all driving conditions. I think the definition of ""improved handling"" is needed here, as this will lower the overall limits of the vehicle, although I concur that it may help steering control (by slowing the vehicle down). Cutting power will never help you go faster.While electronic stability control has improved the emergency handling on the vehicles we have tested, it's not a cure-all for inherently poor-handling vehicles.Again, it seems to echo improved stability (hence the name) but not an actual increase in handling.While I feel that Stability Control may be helpful for vans, SUVs and other poor handling vehicles, I don't know how much it will help on the average sedan. If it makes someone feel more comfortable, I don't see an issue with it for them, it just slows them down when they get into trouble.Most stock, unmodified, mid-sized mid-market sedans have one good swerve. That is, you can swerve to miss the tire that came off the truck in front of you, or the tent that came off the roof rack, etc, but after that swerve, you are headed for the k-barrier. The next swerve, to re-align the vehicle with traffic, is where things get ugly. I have to reserve judgment on DSC for the masses to see if it makes a difference here or not. "

I have to reserve judgment on DSC for the masses to see if it makes a difference here or not.That is exactly what DSC does and you cannot. A good DSC system, like BMWs, can apply the brakes to individual wheels, which you as the driver cannot, to keep the car pointed in the direction of the steering wheel. SHAWD cannot help in this situation unless you gun the gas in an emergency situation.A good DSC type system, like BMWs, will also work to prevent you from getting into a bad situation, before you even know you are in one.

A good DSC type system, like BMWs, will also work to prevent you from getting into a bad situation, before you even know you are in one.How does it know? How does it know what I am trying to do? How does it know what other hazards exist? It primarily tries to control fishtailing, so instead of hitting the k-barrier with the back of the car, I hit it head on. This is not helpful to me.People give up when it comes to emergency situations and vehicle control. You don't lose control of a vehicle, you relinquish control of a vehicle. You might not be able to get the car to do exactly what you want (those pesky laws of physics) but you can usually avoid a worst case scenario, which is all the DSC is going to do anyway (excepting unwieldy vehicles with high center of gravity...read- SUVs and church vans).If you wanted to improve handling, put more power to the outside wheel in turns...oh wait, that is what a limited slip differential does. With respect to braking a wheel:If you brake the inside front wheel on a corner, its not going to make a big difference because there is no weight on that wheel. If you have weight on that wheel, then you aren't at a threshold where you need DSC, you just need to learn how to drive. If you brake the inside rear wheel, that is going to me even more unloaded then the front wheel (watch a VW GTI or a Nissan Sentra autocross, that wheel isn't even on the ground). If you brake the outside front wheel, then you are just going to plow or understeer into the direction you were going previously. If you brake the outside rear wheel, you are going to be facing the direction you were previously coming from. "

You have a seriously simplistic view of how a vehicle handles in a turn. Stability control detects both understeer and oversteer using a yaw sensor and a steering wheel sensor and corrects for both by braking different wheels. It knows where you're trying to go versus where you're actually going. It also cuts power if necessary.Limited slip differentials do NOT send MORE power to the outside wheels. It just prevents all the torque from going to a wheel that is slipping (thus the name).And the braking that is done by ESC does not cause you to lose control - it doesn't lock up the wheel. IF you're understeering and you brake the inside rear wheel a little it helps the car to rotate into the turn (try dragging one foot on a bike). "

Stability control detects both understeer and oversteer using a yaw sensor and a steering wheel sensor and corrects for both by braking different wheels.I would argue that my butt accomplishes the same task, my instructor used to refer to it as ""butt pucker"" Limited slip differentials do NOT send MORE power to the outside wheels. It just prevents all the torque from going to a wheel that is slipping (thus the name).Limited slips prevent all the power going to the wheel that is slipping by sending the power ""from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip"" (to quote Subaru). So the way this translates to me is when coming off ""off-ramp"" going onto ""I-5"", my Contour would do nothing but spin the inside front wheel. The NX2000 w/limited slip could put down all of its 140hp much sooner as I exited the turn.And the braking that is done by ESC does not cause you to lose control - it doesn't lock up the wheel. IF you're understeering and you brake the inside rear wheel a little it helps the car to rotate into the turn (try dragging one foot on a bike).Eh, in reference to my previous point, you never ""lose"" control, you relinquish it. Also, if that inside rear wheel has enough weight on it for braking to make a difference, then there is more cornering potential in the car and someone needs to turn the wheel more.Having raced mountain bikes, I never ""drag your foot"" in a turn because it slows me down. If I put my foot down, it is for stability (called a ""dab""), and it means I am not going as fast as I should be, or I took a bad line or some other issue.Trail braking where you drag the brake a little bit past the initial tun-in to the corner to get some rotation is different and seems to work well for bikes and cars alike.Like I said, I think its probably great technology for the masses, especially those who don't understand that having a top heavy vehicle full of kids might handle differently than an Accord. As far as performance driving goes, I would really like to drive the car myself. "

a) the drag your foot on a bike comment was an analogy, not a recommendationb) if the front wheels have lost grip and are causing understeer, then no amount of grip or acceleration from the inside rear tire is going to correct that. You have only two options - back off the throttle and let the front wheels regain their grip or brake the inside rear wheel only (you can't do that with the seat of your pants) which will help pull the fronts into the turn.I wasn't arguing that stability control is better for pure performance - it's not.

I don't think ESC can really ""improve"" handling. I think the most it can do, is make handling (at the limits) safer. It can make the driver more confident, so he/she will drive closer to the limit than he/she normally would, thereby improving lap times.I think there was discussion a while back about F1 or Indy cars using Traction Control during races.

 The only problem I have with ESC is, Does the cost out-weigh the benefit? I do think ESC is a good thing, overall.

Just saw the un-camo'd pics of the accord, and while I like the coupe a lot, I'm quite underwhelmed with the sedan. The character line on the side looks forced, the hood is too horizontal and square in the front, and the front headlight looks like it extends down the side too much like the altima taillights do. Maybe it will look better in person, but it just doesn't seem to have much flow to it. From what I've seen of the interior, that looks very nice.

Gotta agree with zzzoom6,Coupe: PrettySedan: Meh...Since there is no direct shot of the front of the sedan but base on the coupe's look, it should be descent. The side looks like Honda has lifted out directly from the 5-series. Not bad looking but it's just not ""Honda"". The rear, again, is the weakest link (that's 2 models in the roll now, let's not make it a trend, Honda!). Looks to me like the old Saturn LS300 (Hint: NOT GOOD) with Altezza lights on it.As for interior, although no clear shot has been leaked but based on several spy photos and Honda's own track record I think it will again be class-leading. Overall, I do like the new one better than the current version, especially the coupe. Also, there is no doubt in my mind that this one will continue to out-handle the Camry, out-smooth the Altima and out-refine every other competitors. However, will it outsell the Camry and regain the number 1 spot is yet to be seen.Source: Edmunds InsideLine "

The Accord coupe looks like it should be a hatchback as does that picture of the new Mazda6 and the Altima seems to be about there, too. Nothing wrong with hatchbacks but putting a trunk on and then leaving no room for a lid does not make sense to me.When my wife was looking for a car we checked out a Volvo S40 and that trunk lid was so small that it was to the point where you could pretty much only slide things in horizontally.

rumors are flying around the Mazda and Ford forums this has seemed to be a big problem with Ford lately - what is promised, projected, or otherwise hinted either never happens or is so late in happening that the rest of the competition has long since surpassed whatever actually happens. The Fusion, for example, is also 'hinted' to be getting an 'improved' 3.0 at a whole 240hp and Ford is supposed to be refitting some engine plants to do it. Anticipated for 09 or 10 model year - even if it is a great engine, it will still be several years late relative to what Honda, Nissan, and Toyota already have, and still be a bunch of HP short. The 6, if Ford can get enough production capacity for simply that lower production vehicle, may be more of a possibility for the now available 3.5 which does strike me as being at least, in the same zip code as some of the 'Japanese' engines and, of course the GM 3.6.There does, however, seem to be a history of a lot of unkept promises and/or late arrivals for those of you waiting on Ford to do anything.

The new Accord will sell NOT because on great reputations and the Honda name.That may not be the only reason for the new Honda's success but it certainly does not hurt matters. It is an asset rather than a liability. A very significant one in the grand scheme of things.Ford certainly squandered its Taurus bonanza by letting the car die on the vine but we still bought a 2007 Fusion, partially owing to good experiences (mostly) with Ford products. Hopefully, Ford will not repeat the mistakes it made with the Taurus but none of us can predict the future or all of us would be millionaires.While I certainly agree that the Accord is a fine mid-size automobile, it was also priced out of our range when we purchased a MSRP $27,105 V6 SEL AWD Fusion.If the 08' continues Accord's track record throughout the last decade or so it'll continue to be the best all-around (i.e. handling, comfort, powertrain refinement, interior build quality, ergonomics) midsizer on the market.That's a glowing testimonial, to be sure, but it's also how we feel about our Fusion. The 3.0-liter Duratec V6 may not be state-of-the-art but coupled to a six-speed automatic it is competitive in all areas and a very durable, proven engine that suits us just fine (except for poor in-city, stop-'n-go gasoline mileage, 14.8 mpg).We can agree on one thing: The 2008 Accord will outsell the 2008 Fusion by a large margin. McDonald's will sell more hamburger's than Wendy's, too.I seriously doubt if Ford, GM or Chrysler will ever achieve the sales levels of the Camry or Accord in the mid-size market but that does not mean that their offerings are not competitive with what Toyota and Honda put forth.The buying public now perceives the Camry and Accord to be better products and that perception becomes reality in terms of sales. (McDonald's versus Wendy's.)I still say the 2007 Accord looks better than its successor but it's unlikely that my personal observation will have any effect on Honda sales at all, even if tens of thousands of people agree with me, which is not likely either.In short, Honda probably has another ""hit"" on its hands and that is just fine, too.

My concerns about the 08 Accord are its apparent added size and weight. I think the fuel economy will suffer (it will have a more efficient engine, but the weight will keep mpg about the same, or possible slightly higher highway and slightly lower city). I also think acceleration will be about the same despite more hp. Now if they can keep the weight the same, that is a different story, but I don't think it will happen.I also don't like the looks of the headroom in the rear seat.

a couple of good cases in point both involving the same 3.0DT that from a competitive standpoint should've been laid to rest a long time ago given that both Nissan and Honda had superior V6s (Toyota was actually the Johnny-come-lately to this party) several years (2002 and 03) before the Fusion and/or the Five Hundred ever came to market. The Five Hundred originally was supposed to have the 3.5 in 2005, Ford can't make enough of the engines, kills the car (renaming it the ""Taurus"") - you would think that they could have done something to help their lower volume 'flagship' sedan that didn't take more than 3 years. to do. The same sort of thing could be said about the Fusion - it would be the same sort of 'rocket' (with 260hp) that the Camcordimas already were, so why bother with the car in the first place if an appropriate engine is not available for it and won't be for maybe 5 years after introduction.

Speaking of ASSUMPTIONS - where is your empirical evidence that braking the inside tire does nothing? The evidence from the auto mfrs says otherwise. Who should we believe?I didn't say that braking the inside wheel does nothing, i said braking the inside wheel does nothing AT THE LIMIT. If there is no weight on that wheel, you could take it off the car and its not going to make a difference.I think this started when it was suggested that the system would improve handling. I think that is false. I think it lowers the limits of the vehicle and intervenes to compensate for the lack of driving ability of the general US populace. I am all for it. And if you're in an understeer situation - how would turning the wheel more help?If you are in an ""over the limit"" understeer situation, like going wayyyy to fast into a turn, the front tires are so overloaded they aren't going to take any more input, so braking a front wheel isn't going to help. I would also suggest the inside rear wheel would be unloaded (see above) and dragging it isn't going to provide a whole lot of benefit. Stability control is designed to prevent roll-overs and to keep the car from swapping ends. There was an earlier reference to dragging a foot on a bicycle; a different analogy might be training wheels on a bicycle. Its hard to fall over, but the lean angle is much less than what would be available otherwise. "

I think the pricing on the accord will have a HUGE effect on sales. If, as others are saying, it looks like it borrowed for other midsizes, and doesn't realy stand out, a high price could be bad for sales. people may not spend a couple thousand more for an unremarkable, yet well built and reliable, car.um, as far as looks go of the current sedan, if you were to look up ""unremarkable"" in a dictionary, you may see a pic of an accord  yet they still sell tons of these cars. So long as they still have a good reputation and continue to get good press, I've no doubt the Accord will do well. And Honda has not been inclined to have huge increases in prices with a release of new models in the recent past (civic, odyssey). So if they keep the price about the same and come out with new features like HID headlights, cylinder deactivation, more efficient engines with more HP, and better crash tests (remember the Accord is slated to get a new chassis with better capability to absorb impacts - ACE I think it's called), it will give Honda just enough to talk about how much better their new car is.

Vacation to Maui! Had a great time.. I had a rental car, it was a Dodge Avenger. At first I was excited to try something different. It wore off really quick. As I entered the car.. talk about cheap plastics!! The instrument panel cover was falling off! I pushed it back and clipped it back into place. During the week it came off again. The engine was a 4cyl engine and very, very loud and rough. So rough the car shook at idle. Acceleration was so loud and rough I tried my best not to accelerate!.. I could not believe Dodge would build a car like this and think it could even come close to compete with a 4cyl Honda/Toyota/Ford/Sonata/Mazda or what ever. (I have test driven most of the main players in the 4cyl family sedan arena.) The transmission was very clunky and at somepoints shifts were so hard it shook the car. My wife and kids hated the seats, kids hated the back seats because the seats sat so far back they could not see out of the windows very well. I was very disappointed in Dodge. The outside styling was nice and aggressive in my opinion. Go test drive one of these for yourself. The car had 2,300 miles on it also.By the way.. Saw loads of Toyota Camry's as rentals and on the rental lot next do Dollar.. :surprise: "

Ford can't make enough of the engines, kills the car (renaming it the ""Taurus"") - you would think that they could have done something to help their lower volume 'flagship' sedan that didn't take more than 3 years.The DT35 was delayed so they could make it competitive now and in the future. Originally it was just going to be a larger DT30 but they beefed some things up and made allowances for turbo, hybrid, and DI applications which is the future proof part. It is very competitive with the offerings from Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and GM right now and will remain competitive for years to come. At least that's what I've gathered over the past couple of years while waiting for it. :blush: Why it's not going into the Fusion I don't know. But I do think that the rumored 240 HP PIP DT30 with a 6-speed ATX will be competitive. Not class leading, but competitive. If the other rumor about the DI turbo 2.5L I4 for the '09 Fusion are true then there's your answer to the power ""problem"". "

The same sort of thing could be said about the Fusion - it would be the same sort of 'rocket' (with 260hp) that the Camcordimas already were, so why bother with the car in the first place if an appropriate engine is not available for it and won't be for maybe 5 years after introduction. I can't see how that hurts sales though and that's the bottom line. I've already stated my case on how the Fusion's V6 is a good, if not excellent, compromise to the overpriced V6s of the Camcords and the less powerful I4s of all three. It's priced in the middle and makes people happy as shown by total V6 sales for all three. The Fusion V6 falls right in the middle of the V6s of others and the I4s of all in the class in every category including the all important price category. "

yep, I remember those V8-6-4s that Cadillac championed many many years ago, a disaster for GM if I recall correctly not too much unlike GM trying to make diesel engines out of their small block V8s - leading to things like excessive recalls, extended warranties, and crappy resale values. Things like this a good part of the fall of the 'Detroit' empire - meaning they can't build smaller engines well, so let's try these 'tricks' - and further proof that technology is not always good. My own observation of the system in operation in a 300C is that it is almost undetectable except that it won't hold the car's speed without reverting back to 8 cylinders at any speed over about 65 or so - even on a flat road. Maybe a part of the reason that the 300C has been listed (by CR) as the most overrated in terms of EPA FE ratings? Haven't heard of any reliability issues with these new systems though, so I guess that something has gotten a little easier to do since way back when. "

An engine is just a big air pump. I think to deactivate cylinders they probably do something with the valves, the ignition and or the fuel. I also would think they stagger (or even vary) which pistons are firing an which ones aren't. The pistons would increase parasitic loss but probably not too much. This is pretty much the same way a Jake Brake works on a diesel engine. "

I can't see how that hurts sales though and that's the bottom linerespectively suggest that your head may be in the sand. Camcordimas outsell Fusions by about 10 to 1. Why? The Fusion is otherwise an intelligently designed and competitive car at least until you pop the hoods. A quick check shows a rebate and/or financing incentives available right now on the Fusion but NOTHING on the other 3. And this is all because the Fusion is selling well? It may be selling well for a sedan with a blue oval on it, but certainly not relative to the real players in this class. Had Ford been able to put refined and efficient engines in the Fusion - we wouldn't be having this conversation now.And sure a Camcordima is 'overpriced' (your word) relative to things like Fusions - at least until it comes time to trade them in. Or maybe if initial purchase price is what determines 'overpriced' then the Sonata ought to be the sedan of choice - it does, at least, have a better engine that you can certainly get for about the same number as a Camcordima 4 banger, resale values and TCO be damned!

respectively suggest that your head may be in the sand. Camcordimas outsell Fusions by about 10 to 1. Why?Not in the V6 arena though which is where your head is in the sand. :P Very few Camcords are sold with the V6 and the majority of Fusions are sold with the V6. If the V6 in the Fusion is so bad then why is it selling so well?BTW, the F-150 outsells everything and it has the weakest engines of all pickups. Having a more powerful V6 in the mid-sized sedan segment does not increase sales overall. IMO, if Honda and Toyota offered only the I4 their sales would not drop all that much. Their reputations and overall ""goodness"" of the products they offer appeal to the masses and THAT is what drives the sales. What doesn't drive sales is having 40 more horses than the other guy in their lowest volume copies. It helps them sell some V6 copies over the other guys but not the big sellers which are I4s.A quick check shows a rebate and/or financing incentives available right now on the Fusion but NOTHING on the other 3.Maybe in your area that's true but right now I can get $1000 off of a Fusion V6 SEL ($250 more if my VIN meets a certain criteria, whatever that means, and push the dealer), $1950 off of an Accord V6 sedan if I push the dealer, and $2000 (or $2500 with some coupon)off of a Sonata Limited V6.

The FWD TL-S (relatively same size as the Camry) has 287HP and almost no torque steer.I'd have to agree with akirby on all accounts. I've driven my cousin's '06 TL and it has plenty of torque steer. Unless Honda did something similar to what Mazda does in the MAZDASPEED3 to reduce torque steer, I don't see how the TL-S has almost none and I don't see how adding more power to these mainstream machines will produce different results. One of the biggest complaints from MT, C&D, and the like about the TL has been it's torque steer. See here. Quote from the link:""While 270 horsepower from a six-cylinder seems reason enough to purchase a TL over less-potent competitors--BMW 330i and the Lexus IS 300--torque steer (the TL is a front-driver) remains an always-present problem whenever the engine is delivering max juice. Suggested one editor: ""If Acura wants to sell a front-drive car with this much horsepower, the engineers should figure how to tune out the wheel wiggle.""""The reason why the V6 Camry/Accord is sold at less percentage is because of the higher price.Exactly!!! And the Fusion V6 sells much better than the others because it is a good compromise in most ways. If people were so concerned about HP then the opposite would be true. "

From Edmunds Inside Line:Putting the power downYou might suspect a front-driver with 256 lb-ft of twisting torque to be a tarmac-nibbling handful and it would have been had it not also included a helical-gear-type limited-slip differential (LSD) in the six-speed manual transmission. This long-standing torque-steer-reduction scheme works by dividing the driving force more equally between the two front wheels. In the case of the TL Type-S, it works very well. The only time we noticed the steering affected by the throttle was at the very top of both 1st and 2nd gear under full throttle. Otherwise, the car's cornering was tack-sharp both off and on the gas. The LSD also does an admirable job of diminishing understeer. First Drive: 2007 Acura TL Type-SI also test drove the TL-S last December. The torque is minimal but not completely gone.PS.

Which tradeoff do you want is the big question.Some cars have a low speed only traction control to help them get started on slippery surfaces with an automatic transmission Some cars have ""all speed"" traction control which uses sensors to limit wheel slip. The all speed traction control can also use the system to limit torque steer by retarding engine output. A limited slip makes the car want to go straight, I would think that would exacerbate torque steer by pulling the car in the direction of traction. In FWD cars, using ""equal length"" half shafts supposedly helps also (I'm not refuting that at all, I just haven't looked into it that much).AWD (w/diffs) just distributes the power to more places, so each place can handle more of the job of transmitting power before it gets overwhelmed. I think the old '89 Probe GT had the most torque steer of any vehicle I'd ever driven, short of a highly modified early 90s Maxima. Does the Acura have a real limited slip like a torsen or something?

2540,"June 28, 2007 11:30AM","
lilengineerboy ","
Does your Mustang have a real mechanical limited slip also? My understanding of the way it works is it looks at how fast all of the wheels are going and grabs the one that is too far out of range and slows it down. On slippery surfaces, you can have your drive wheels going 30 with the front wheels not moving. If you do a burn out, I don't think the variation is that much, you don't need the drive wheels to be going that much faster than the non-drive wheels. It also might be less sensitive if both drive wheels are going faster than the 2 non-drive wheels.ABS is also based on the speed difference between the wheels, so in low speed conditions, even if one wheel is going 5 or 10 and the other wheel is going 0, it might not be a big enough difference and the wheel may lock.On my Contour w/o traction control, when starting and driving on a low traction surface, the ABS sensors can't get a sync so the system can't initialize, presumably because all the wheels are going different speeds passed the speed where it does its snapshot (I think its 7 mph or so). This flags the ABS light and I don't have ABS until the vehicle is ignition is cycled. Oh, and I didn't mean to imply that only automatic transmission vehicles can have TC. I think it is more important for auto trans cars however, since its easier to modulate the torque and power going to the wheels with the clutch. "

Does your Mustang have a real mechanical limited slip also?It sure does. I did notice that when the TC did come on this past winter there was that clicking/grinding sound you hear when the ABS comes on during braking and it seemed to originate from around the master cylinder somewhere.I ask all of this because the Mazda6 I had previously seemed to have the same type of system where it did allow for some wheel spin. Not as much as the Mustang does but moreso than our Explorer or any other TC equipped vehicle I've ever driven. Are TC systems pretty standard out of a box or is there a large allowance for customization?Oh, and I didn't mean to imply that only automatic transmission vehicles can have TC. I think it is more important for auto trans cars however, since its easier to modulate the torque and power going to the wheels with the clutch.Agreed on all accounts. That's one of the reasons I like driving a stick so much actually. Way more control IMO. "

V6 in the Fusion is so bad then why is it selling so well?it isn't selling well - the answer to your question as to why a majority of Ford have the V6 is 1) because it is cheap and 2) because the 4 cylinder is that bad. There have been a number of posts on this forum discussing whether or not a 4 cylinder Accord can really keep up with a 6 cylinder Fusion, I guess it turns out to be close except in one area - the Accord 4 banger is a smoother and more refined engine than any V6 DT ever thought of being and obviously burns a whole lot less petrol. Dealer discounts on an outgoing model designs are bad examples for comparison purposes - but if they are starting to discount the 07 Accords like you claim, it certainly should make the car that much less expensive to own than a Fusion.

as a former owner of some great Altima 4 bangers, I can't say I disagree - but - IMO, it is Honda that still (remember the CVCC 4 bangers back in the late 70s) sets the standard in 4 cylinder engines specifically - not necessarily in HP but how wonderfully smooth and quiet they are, and yes more so in that regard than certainly the DT 3.0. The only real point that I've been trying to make for months now is that the Fusion in particular would be a whole lot better and easily a more competitive car in this class if Ford somehow could manage to put engines in it similar to what everybody else now is doing. to akirby that thinks most folks pick a car and then pick an engine to go with it - maybe so - but not this buyer - I'll do it exactly the other way around. A rough feeling, coarse sounding engine is what makes or breaks my driving pleasures. It is almost worth buying the 4 cylinder Accord with only the MT just for the experience of how it sounds and feels as you encourage the engine do what it does best. "

My 2006 Hyundai has been far more reliable, and trouble-free, than my 2007 Toyota Camry. For those who speak about reliability without ever owning distinct samples, I provide empirical experience owning both a Hyundai and Toyota. Surprised, yes, I am, but facts don't lie. The Hyundai has never seen the dealer for a warranty issue; the Toyota has been into the dealer 4 times since its purchase for warranty issues. Overall build-quality on the Hyundai, including panel gaps and matching, as well as other aspects are the equal to the Toyota. A crappy car Hyundai is not . . ., it's no longer the late '80s. "

So long as they still have a good reputation and continue to get good press, I've no doubt the Accord will do well. I'd put my money on it selling well, but things are different now, than when the last gen was released. the last year or two, honda has been offering great deals on accords, better than I ever remember seeing. those will dissapear. and with the midsize market much more competitive this time, a significant price increase could be trouble. throw into that the fact that being the #2 midsize, every car company is taking direct aim at it and the camry. every comercial you see is basicly ""our car is better than the camcord for this reason"". and with the competetion holding the line on their prices, honda doesn't want to be know as ""the most expensive midsize""now on the flip side, if they can do like nissan did (the 2007 altima only went up $200 from the 2006 price) they just may pass the camry and take that best selling car spot away from toyota.

I'd have to agree...the 4 cylinder in the civic SI is just incredible. It sounds amazing and it is always enticing you to get into the vtec zone where the fun really begins. But driving in my friends Element is not so fun and does not sound nearly as good...but what do you expect for a box on wheels that weighs much more than the Civic. One thing that I didn't like about my Legacy was how clackity the engine sounded. On the newer subies, they have put much better sound absorbing material so you don't hear it unless you get out of your car, but it always seemed that the boxer engine just didn't hold a candle to the Accord engine in my previous car. Now that I have the v-6 mazda6, I think this car sounds so much better than the other two cars. While it is quiet when puttering around town, at higher rpms a nice growl comes from the heart of the car. It has a deeper throatier tone to it, especially compared to most 4 cylinders, that builds nicely in volume and tone as power and speed grow. While the 4 cylinder version of the mazda6 was quite fun and just a little more than a second slower than the v-6, it just didn't have the broader torque curve or the sweet sound of the v-6. So I think most consumers who are used to the higher pitched whine of a 4 banger, a nicely tuned v-6 would sound much better to buyers who like the sensory experiences of driving. "

I have gotten used to the Legacy sound. I like it, I like the feeling that there is a motor in the front and you can hear it. The engine output shaft is inline with the car (its not transverse mounted engine like most of the cars in the class) and you can feel it torquing a little against its mounts.I definitely don't see the Legacy as the model of refinement, but I am not ready for the retirement home just yet so having a car that feels like a car doesn't bother me that much. I actually would strongly consider a Legacy 2.5GT sedan but we already have a wagon and I can't bring myself to get two of the same car.The Contour's little V6 sounded good when it was working hard, but the 4 cylinder SR20 in the older Sentras did too. I think it has a lot to do with the intake and exhaust designs (both cars had Borlas and a CAI). "

Sorry, I should have been more clear...my legacy was a 2.5 from 1996. I test drove the 2005 legacy non-gt and it sounded much better and more refined. The thing that I really liked about that car was it's acceleration from a stop...maybe it's a torqueier engine or the awd gives it great grip, but off the line, it was pretty quick.

I didn't mean to make it sound like I was refuting your statement, I think the Subie's motor is a bit less refined feeling than say, the VQ or the Toyota one that Captain likes. I just happened to like the way the boxer engine feels in that application, and it has been returning very good fuel economy.I have no hesitation recommending the Subaru to friends and family, but at the same time, if you don't want AWD and tend to be neglectful of maintenance, I think there are more robust choices.

I don't remember the model designations, but I do remember that her previous Camry before the '05 was the 4-cyl, and the '05 had the V6.Not trying to bash the Aura here and indeed it is a great effort from GM but it is not even in the same zip code with the Lexus in any category.That's your opinion. AFAIC, the Aura is not only a ""great effort from GM"", but it's a great effort from ANY automaker that can stand toe-to-toe with the class leaders. When a former Camry owner, who swore up and down she'd never buy ""American"" again, decides on an Aura after test-driving the other offerings (Camry, Accord, Altima, Milan), that's saying something.

""The Impala SS BTW is a torque steering handful with all that weight and HP/torque hitting those particular front wheels, guess the new 4000lb+ RWD model will address that issue at the expense of even more gas... As I said, unless you are drag racing the front drive car with V8, it is as normal as any other car. My friends dad had a 1973 Eldorado convertible with the 500 ci engine that definately had torque steer when peeling out, but his father only let him drive it on his birthday, and his father didn't have a traction problem when he drove it himself. Buick put a V8 engine in the car to attract the kind of buyers that want a V8. Heck, you can get a four cylinder car to outperform a V8 car, so to each his own. On the Impala forums those who drive there V8 SS cars hard have noticed the torque steer, but you get used to it. In another year or so the Impala/Grandprix (G8) will be going to rear-wheel drive for people like you. The Buick might as well stay front wheel for the extra security in winter traction. "

We would definitely buy another SEL Fusion again but probably the 160-horsepower I4 engine.Fully 95 percent of our mileage is stop-'n'-go, short hop, in-city driving. Even our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon, with a four-cylinder, 2.0-liter Zetec, only delivers 22-23 mpg under these same conditions.The Fusion is a fine mid-size sedan with a host of creature comforts and nice touches. The fit and finish -- inside and out -- is perfect, superb, couldn't be any better. The car handles like it is glued to rails and the 221-horsepower Duratec V6 has ample power.We did a lot of Internet research before we bought the car but never actually test drove any of its competitors.

was under the impression that the Malibu was going to be closer to the Aura XR (in top trims). Have driven the XR, and besides liking how it looked and a general improvement in the fit/finish dept (still below Camcords, IMO), I found the 3.6 to be an apparently very solid engine. Smooth, easily revved, quiet, and good power, of course - some Nissan-like torque steer, however.Pontiac has always favored the 'sport' side of things so I'm not sure how the G6 is related to the XR or FTM the Malibu.

CR's reviews seem to cover cars for non auto enthusiasts... all about practicality and how ""appliance"" like a car is. of course these things are important, but I find that car reviews in edmunds, for example (shameless plug :blush: ) much more well rounded and I get a better feel of where the car fits in it's segment. if CR were to review a ferrari, I bet they would say that there wasn't enough trunk space, the car was too loud, and the mpg weren't as good as other ""sports"" cars. and the idea that just because CR does not take ads does not mean they are unbiased. everyone has their bias, and reputation will always play a role in developing opinions.

IIRC, the gov't says that manufacturers are allowed to start selling upcoming models beginning January 1 of the year before the model year designation. The reason for this has to do with EPA emissions and mileage ratings. So after January 1, 2007 a new model can be called a 2008 model year vehicle if the manufacturer so desires. Some manufacturers also do this so that they can have extended sales periods of vehicles to make their sales volume appear higher. Then again, I might not be remembering it correctly.

The following is from Wikipedia:The model year of a product is a number used to describe approximately when a product was produced. However, the model year and the actual year of production don't always coincide.AutomobilesIn the United States, automobile model years traditionally start in the third quarter of the preceding year. In other cases products of a previous model year can continue production, especially if a newer model hasn't yet been released. In that case, the model year remains the same until a new model is introduced. This is to ensure that the model will be seen by the public and will actually sell an amount of vehicles before a new vehicle model is produced and people will look at the newer model rather than the previous one.In the United States, for regulation purposes, government authorities allow cars of a given model year to be sold starting on January 2 of the previous calendar year.

SO very true!!! Initial satisfaction surveys suffer from the strongest influences in human nature, ego and the desire to have spent your money well.

I LOVE the fact that CR is the only review source that would criticize a new Ferrari for lack of trunk space, running too loudly, and not getting enough MPG!That is the essence of fair, consistent reviews, across the board, no matter what the price.The ultimate ""perfect"" car would have decent trunk space, get great MPG, and if it is loud, would be a ""pleasing"" sound, and only mainly when your accelerating quickly, not just loud and annoyous at idle. CR does look at the fact that ""30 MPG is excellent for a powerful V6, vs. 40 MPG being excellent for a 4 banger."" But all in all, even a 400 HP supercar should get good mileage in a perfect world.

:sick: >maybe even for a period of 3 years. But watch out when that warranty expires and the car goes to hell in typical domestic fashion. The warranty is 100,000 miles. :blush:  :surprise: Such a broad brush. Maybe off topic but I'll bite. I've been amazed at the assumptions made by people who haven't owned a domestic car in the 90s and later who try to make them seem unreliable. Perhaps that's better saved for some of the foreign brands riding on their reputation who have had problems with their redesigns in the last few years. Overall I agree with a post in some discussion I saw recently that if you take good care of a domestic just the way some take good care of the foreign product and you'll get the same results. If you don't take good care of the oil changes and maintenance schedule with a foreign brand you'll get the same result as you get when you don't take care of the domestic. I saw a Honda Accord knocking it's way home that was a few years old. I saw a wrecker dragging it away a few days later. The lady probably didn't take care of it--it was a model before 03 but I don't know the exact year but it was less than 10 years old. :confuse: "

Sometimes, sometimes not. Some manufacturers, Kia comes to mind, like to play the ""halfsies"" game, e.g. the all-new 2006.5 Optima (did the same thing when the Spectra was redesigned a few years ago). But it's getting more common to introduce a car very early in the year and slap the next year on it. Toyota has done this multiple times in recent years; Chrysler has done it; probably others I'm not remembering right now. I guess there's multiple reasons for this, including people seem to want the latest and greatest, but also it may save automakers money because they get almost two years out of one model year--assuming they shift to fall intros for subsequent years (not always the case, e.g. Hyundai has been starting new model years for the Sonata in spring since the '06 debuted in the U.S. in spring of 2005).

that's pretty quick for Hyundai to be redoing the Sonata... I am surprised it's not doing too well since I think it is a great value. Granted, it's not a car that I found too appealing for my tastes during the few days I had it as a rental, but I was impressed at the build quality and the powertrain (except for manumatic downshifts that took way too long). In the end, I think it shows how much of a stranglehold Honda and Toyota has on this segment when a good quality car that is aimed at the same type of consumer that sells for several thousands less is overlooked so often. Even with Hyundai getting good press lately for reliability and solid build quality, they still have a long way to go before people forget or forgive them for making the shoddy cars of 15 years ago. I think Hyundai is making a good move in trying to make the car visually more appealing and distinct; they need more than a ""me too"" ad campaign to succeed given the bad rep baggage they carry along. For the Sonata to do well, I think they need a car that says, ""I deserve to be looked at as a solid car and don't need to be compared to others to be chosen."" Most of the characteristics of the Sonata are very good; it shouldn't take much for them to start doing really well. "

Of all the angles, the front 3/4 view of the Accord is by far the best; it looks pretty good from that angle. But I still think the side profile has no flow and the rear 3/4 view has that strange headlight bubble and the back is just ugly. I'm surprised their leaking such complete views so early... Honda must be low on current model inventory and are just trying to slow sales of other manufacturers models until they can get the new Accord onto lots.Anybody feeling the chrome handles?

Three years is the typical timeframe for a mid-gen redux for Hyundai. The Gen 3 Sonata had a similar facelift after three years, with both the front and rear being restyled for 2002.As for needing to be so good it doesn't need to be compared to other cars... I don't think any brand of mid-sized car is at that point, or will be anytime soon. It's a very competitive market. "

After seeing these clear photos from all sides, my thoughts are...* Oh, look how they took the taillamps off the Sonata but didn't take the part that extends onto the trunk lid.* The roofline is a dead ringer for the Optima (and many other cars too, but in this class, mostly the Optima).* The side character line looks Acura-esque--I wonder if that's because in some markets, the car will be sold as an Acura?* The door handles, especially the chrome ones, look too big for the car.* The grille is really, really ugly. Hideous, IMO. I'm not sure why Honda would put a grille like that on an otherwise sleek-looking car. It looks very un-Hondalike, except maybe the Ridgeline. It reminds me of something Suzuki might do, or Subaru before they came to their senses. "

You obviously don't own any late model (last 3 years) domestic vehicle. This isn't 1990 anymore.Some of you are making it sound like domestic vehicles have done a complete 180... however, my 2004 was a different story, requiring a shop visit every few months of ownership, starting from day three:-Brand new, there was a whining noise from rear end at 15-20 mph (changed pitch as speed increased) in either 1st or 2nd gear; selling dealer stated problem could not be duplicated. The noise didn't worsen, although TSB&#146;s were issued for improper fluid in rear diffs, which were known to fail.-Rear passenger door wouldn&#146;t open from inside at time of purchase; repaired under warranty.-When cruising at low RPM&#146;s, a sudden lift of the throttle (such as to switch to the brake in slowing traffic) would occasionally cause an extremely harsh bang and jolt from the transmission (the first time this happened I thought I had run something over). This problem faded somewhat after the manufacturer ""fix"" (see below) and seemed to improve with time and mileage, however it was still present after the transmission flush at around 40k miles.-Hesitation shifting from park to drive, or drive to reverse (as in 3-pt turn), requiring use of throttle and followed by a very harsh engagement; a transmission solenoid was replaced and a transmission fluid additive was added to fix (all under warranty).-Squeaky front suspension; very noticeable when driving over speed bumps; front suspension bushings replaced under warranty.-Brake rotors rusted heavily around 15,000 miles, causing vibration when braking from high speeds; fixed under warranty (new pads, rotors turned); problem resurfaced and became more pronounced less than 4,000 miles later.-Around 15,000 miles, humming noise from rear at 60-70 mph regardless of gear; only present when throttle open.-&#147;Hooting&#148; noise from A/C around 2,000 RPMs; evidently common according to dealer.-Rear ABS sensor failed -just- out of warranty, requiring a $60 part plus labor to install.-Brakes were shot (again...) at 42k miles. Evidently the rotors would go first, then eat the pads...-Lever to fold second row passenger seat had stopped actuating the internal release by trade-in (seat would not fold).Funny thing was, on the Edmunds ""problems and solutions"" board, there were many people having these same problems, but we were all irritated mainly because our dealers acted like nothing was wrong... What good is a warranty if the manufacturer constantly denies there is a problem and won't honor it? "

At least at Ford the turnaround started with new models introduced after the 2005 model year. Fusion and Milan are equal to or better than the Camcords right now (even by CR standards) and that is almost a 180 from the 10 yr old Taurus. The new 500 (now Taurus), Explorer, Mustang, F150 have all proven much more reliable than previous models. Even the Focus is now a CR recommended buy after all the initial recall problems. Ford at least has made a significant process change in how they design and build vehicles and while I wouldn't call it a 180 it's at least a 135. The launch of the Edge and MKX was delayed almost a month because Ford requires the plant to run for 5 straight days without a single assembly defect. Several times they got to 3 or 4 days and had to start over. But they made it.Yes, the dealer network is still a problem and the manufacturers unfortunately don't have much control over that.

How many people do you know drive a car for 30k miles a year for at least 10 years? Not many I know of. Average miles on a car these days is around 12k a year. I drive a lot less than that. In the Rust Belt, ten years is a long time to own a car and still have it rust-free. (Come to think of it though, the only car I ever owned that showed rust after only five years was a Honda--a Civic.) If you peruse the Hyundai ownership discussions here, you'll see many reports from owners with over 100k reliable miles on their Hyundais over 5-7 years. That's enough to build a reputation for long-term reliability, IMO.But Sonata outsell CamCord? Not anytime soon. Hyundai currently has neither the manufacturing capacity or dealer network to come anywhere close to Accord or Camry in sales volume. Their current production in Alabama is limited to 300k a year right now--and that must be shared with the Santa Fe, for which sales are surging. So if Hyundai increases sales of the Sonata from the current 12k or so to about 15k a month, that will max out capacity in Alabama if they do 10k Santa Fes a month. Then they have to find excess capacity overseas or expand the Alabama plant. "

Did Fusion take away a few potential sales? Likely. There are cross-shopping all over the midsize segment so potential takeaways are likely for every car out there.Here is one of the reasons for the fall:Hyundai started a program to get ""as many butts into the Sonata as possible"". They sent a great number of units into fleet in 2006 in hopes for improved brand recognition.The sales dip is reported by way of year-over-year (YOY) (e.g. June 2007 vs. June 2006). Of course, comparing the normal amount sold in 2007, and the large amount of units reported last year (2006), including the ones sent via the fleet program, would be a skewed comparison. I don't think it'd be surprising to see sales dip throughout the rest of this year using the YOY comparison.The previous generation barely made 10K/month during its cycle, while the current Sonata has made that number stand up.The other issue, as stated by backy, capacity restraint at the Alab. plant.

The biggest slap in the face was being able to go online and look up the TSBs that specifically detailed my problems, but not being able to get any of the dealers to help me out. Even more, the ""fixes"" suggested by Ford were just band-aids. You read the description of my problems. Fluid additives? C'mon, Ford.This was 2004. I expected my new cars transmission to shift smoothly, my brake rotors to last more than 15,000 miles, and my engine to crank on the first try, every time. Ford didn't deliver that for me. It would be hard to give them another shot. "

Stuff that makes the car go is all covered in powertrain warranty?I seriously wonder if batteries, alternator, serpentine, and timing belts are covered. I wonder if the starter cables, ignition, and other wires are covered. If you can't start you can't go. If your battery dies because the alternator isn't charging the electrical system will die and the car will die on the road while running (at least it did in my domestic) How about the brakes, hard to go if you can't stop safely. Is it okay to ""go"" if your gas tank is leaking because of a bad O-ring? You can ""GO"" without an AC, but it's HOT in CA, goodluck with that! Also, an A/C repair could cost close to just as much as a transmission replacement, potentially. There are lots of EXPENSIVE repairs and ""have to have in order to go"" items not covered in the powertrain I believe. "

My statement wasn't about imports or domestics in general, but more specifically that a 100K powertrain warranty with 3 years bumper to bumper is still only marginally better than a 4 year bumper to bumper with 50K powertrain.Yes, many of the items I mentioned are wear and tear items. But they shouldn't wear or tear on year 3 and one day! Nor mile 36,101. Would anyone argue that all warranties shouldn't be AT LEAST 4 years and 50K ""bumper to bumper."" I realize that bumper to bumper is not longer the same as it might of been 15 years ago, with exclusions galore in the fine print, but still, most everything I mentioned should last at least long enough to outlive the warranty.

manufacturers would be foolish to warrant such items (and would soon go broke doing so)manufacturers obviously do these kind of things to represent a quality and/or faith in their own products and mostly because they HAVE TO as a function of sales. It was, after all, the Koreans that effectively started this kind of thing in an attempt to 'live down' some rather questionable products sold not that many years ago. The consumer, in turn, perceives a level of quality that may or may not be there. As far as 'going broke', be careful of what you wish for, these long term warranties have no value if there is no company left to stand behind it. Given Cerebus' apparent (and rumored) plans to sell off Chrysler in pieces, how much exactly do you suppose their warranties are worth? "

I'm sure that Ford and Hyundai are both making great strides in quality when it comes to their midsize sedan offerings. The intital quality reports sure seem to bear that out. However, I for one won't be convinced until 2012, when I can check the long-term reliability ratings of the 2006 Sonata and Fusion. If they are still rated as good as Honda and Toyota vehicles of the same vintage, then I'll certainly consider whatever midsize sedans Hyundia and Ford are offering in 2012, so long as they are still receiving high ""initial quality"" ratings.

The Accord and Camry are still very well executed products and all the others really need to show the Honda and Toyota faithful that they need to try the other guys too. The recent good press will help but it ain't gonna work on its own. And I have yet to see anything from the big three, marketing wise, that would make me say WOW I gotta have one of those!

Folks like the editors of Edmunds.com disagree with you on that one. They have multiple Hyundais as their ""Most Wanted"" for 2007.Also, the facts disagree with you. Take a look for example at the EPA charts--Sonata is #1 in its EPA class. Elantra (considered by EPA a mid-sized car) is near the top of its EPA class.You also forgot some categories that are important for mid-sized sedan buyers--not everyone is focused on power, for example. The Sonata has class-leading standard safety equipment. Important for many people. I think it may also be tops in this class in interior room--also important for many people. Also tops (tied with Optima and Galant) for warranty coverage--important for many people. "

Coming off of that experience, I had trouble seriously considering a less expensive Ford sedan, or any Ford for that matter.Bender, what's the old investment saying, ""Past experience is no guarantee of future performance?"" Even so, given your experiences with the Explorer, I, too, would be leery of Ford products.Our experience with past and present Ford products has been quite good for the most part -- a fuel pump here, an alternator there, regular maintenance items, brakes, batteries, tires (but no abnormal wear).We now have an exceptional Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer in town, Sherwood of Salisbury (Md.) and that played a big part in our decision to buy a new 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion from them. Many times a car or truck is only going to be as good as the dealer that backs it up. Apparently, you had a problem in that area as well, unfortunately for both you and the FoMoCo.Previous bad experiences often tip the scale when it comes time to purchase a car, either new or previously owned. The fine track record for Accords and Camrys serves their manufacturers well and is a huge contributing factor to their continued position as sales leaders in the mid-size sedan segment.It's highly unlikely that any of the other manufacturers will overtake Accord and Camry unless Honda and Toyota really screw something up, especially in the power train department.Although styling, handling are important, the most crucial factor of vehicle ownership may well be reliability. Except for poor in-city mileage, 14.8 mpg, our Fusion has been perfect for seven months and its first 3,700 miles. Yes, I'm knocking on wood.Will it be that way at 37,000 miles or 107,000 miles?

(A 5 year old design by the way).488 HP and 430 lb/ft of torque while getting 40/60 mpg, oh yeah baby! :P A warranty of 6 years or 72K miles, with a powertrain warranty of 8 years and 120K miles!

If you peruse the Hyundai ownership discussions here, you'll see many reports from owners with over 100k reliable miles on their Hyundais over 5-7 years. That's enough to build a reputation for long-term reliability, IMO. 100K miles and 5 to 7 years maybe be ENOUGH to show reliability to some people, maybe even the average person, but to the person looking for some of the best stuff out there, you have to look to cars that reach 15 years and 250K+ plus regularly.

Quality is in the eyes of the beholder.KD, beauty (styling) may be in the eyes of the beholder but quality (fit and finish) is something that can be measured. It's quantitative not subjective: The paint is flawless or it's not; the body seams are aligned or they aren't. An imperfection is an imperfection. All cars usually have one or two (more?). I have given our 2007 Fusion the once over with a fine-tooth comb, metaphorically, several times and have found no flaws. I find the workmanship to be perfect, at least so far.Are there things that I would like to see improved or added? Of course. A light in the glove compartment would be nice. Is that a quality issue? Not hardly. Would I rather see a shark fin antenna rather than one with a mast? Absolutely. But that, too, is not a quality item, more of a personal preference.A piece of molding that falls off or is misaligned is a quality item, a flaw, something that can be scored, rated. Where it is placed is subjective. How it is attached is not.Again, Accord and Camry usually score highly in the area of quality. They both have high standards. But so do the Fusions, if ours is typical, and I believe that to be the case. "

for any buyer that has ever had a lemon-like vehicle in the past is reliability, dependability, and quality.Unless you have time and money to burn.For me, the following are crucial:Power to economy ratio.... I want maximum power for every gallon of gas my engine will drink. If you have the most HP AND the most MPG, then it's a complete no brainer to me. Price to quality to reliability to dependability to warranty ratio. Again, a warranty should be irrelevant to a well-built vehicle.Interior quality of materials and craftsmanship. I love the interior quality and build of an Audi, but Honda's are so much more ergonomical and user friendly. They are both excellent examples of how to do interiors properly. And lastly...

If 1992 Accords and Camrys are a ""regular"" occurance, how come I don't see hardly any of them on the road, when so many were sold?The ""average person"" would need to drive a car for 20 years to hit 250k miles. Few people stick with a car that long. If they could, before rust catches up.I owned a 1991 Caravan and it was rock-solid reliable. Looked and drove like new when I sold it after eight years. Would it have held up for another 7 years? Maybe. Would I want to own it for another 7 years? Nope. My needs had gone far beyond that vehicle in that time. If a Dodge can hold up for a long time, why pay the premium for an Accord or Camry just because you want to drive it into the ground? At the end, you'll have a car that is worth almost nothing. So save your money up front and buy the lowest-priced car that meets your needs--like a Fusion or Mazda6 or Sonata maybe. They'll all last many years with proper care. "

Your joking statement is really ""twice as good at half the price."" That would make it something close to 4 times as good.And, your twice as good warranty is 1 year or 12K miles better than Hyundai's B2B but 2 years less (and 20K miles more) than Hyundai's power train. "

I guess someone would have to be part of the ""us"" group to understand. It makes no sense to me. To me, buying any used car is a gamble. never know what the previous owner did or didn't do to it. and many times, they sell their cars because they know something you don't. I swore off buying used cars long, long ago. No way in the world I pay MORE for a used car that somebody possibly abused the hell out of, realized what he did, and decided to unload it, than I would for a brand new, 100k warrantied car. just because it had an ""H"" on the grille, or the toyota logo. I totally agree. I'll never buy used for the exact reasons you state. I've got my eyes on a Hyundai when my daughter reaches driving age in a little over a year. I want her to have a safe, new car with (hopefully) no issues. A used Civic? Na. A new Accent for the same money? Probably.And I'm a diehard Honda-er. But they don't have a lock on building good cars. "

C&D thinks maybe MY09 we'll see it in the Fusion. That's right in line with what I've read on other forums from Ford sources. It appears, from the articles I've read, that the TwinForce DI 2.5L I4 option for the Fusion will get 30% better fuel economy than the current I4 and offer more power. At what cost I don't know.Add a little restyle inside and out (which we've possibly seen before here), another plant to meet demand and they're back in business. :shades: "

Hyundai Sonata's long-term reliability rating has been climbing since approx the 2000 model year. Granted that was the previous generation Sonata, but if we can assume Accord/Camry reliability ratings carry forward from one generation to another, we should apply the same standard to the Sonata unless proven otherwise. You're asking for a 6 year track record. Sonata already has a 7 or so year track record. "

There are plenty of great used cars out there. I won't argue that, but there are plenty more used cars that are junk, abused, mistreated ect.And if it has an ""H"" on the grill, you don't need a warranty, right?  when did I ever imply that? I've been fortunate. I've been able to buy new for awhile now. Not anything I want, (never spent more than 23k) but if for some reason my finances changed, and I had to lower my spending amount to 15k, I would get the best new car I could for 15k. not a used, out of warrnaty one becase of the badge, whichever one it was.and actually pay more for that used one to boot.

This suggests that cars aren't lasting more than the warranty periods. Well, my '05 Sonata GLS SV power train warranty is 10 years. If it quits after 10 years in will have cost me $1670 per year, plus 1/10th of the sales tax and other minor gov't charges. If a Camcord quits at the end of it's warranty, what is it's annual cost?That's a beauty of the Hyundai warranty...no major expenses until after the car loan has been paid off. "

Relating back to a recent thread, this is an interesting choice: a used Camry for which the bumper-to-bumper warranty is expired, probably due for new tires soon (maybe it has new tires?), expensive 60k service due in 22k miles, and the previous-generation design... which was rated by most professional reviewers as behind cars like the Fusion and Sonata... vs. a brand-new mid-sized car like a Fusion, Milan, Sonata, Optima, or even a loaded Elantra (mid-sized interior, compact length) for about the same money. I'd go with the brand-new car (I'm very particular about break-in and maintenance), but if the Camry were Certified with an extended warranty and had all maintenance up to date and new rubber, and was in impeccable comdition, that could make it tougher.

On my way home from work, it seemed like everyone was way too impatient to get their holiday started, so there was a lot of really bad driving, much moreso than usual. So I'm driving at 45mph passing cars stopped at a stop light in the lane that goes the opposite way as me, and out pops a bmw making a left turn right in front of me. To my left are all the cars waiting for the light to turn green, and to the right is a concrete wall...nowhere to go. Slam on my brakes and stop 3 feet from a fairly new 3 series bmw and a really freaked out girl sitting in the bmw's passenger seat. My first thought was #$%@^&amp;*!!!. My second thought was glad I drove a Mazda6 with some of the best brakes in this class. So lesson #1... drive safely over the holidays people!!! Expect some really bad driving and be patient.And lesson #2... if you're in the market for a new car, remember, good brakes can not only save you the hassle of getting your car fixed and appraised by an adjuster, but it could keep you and others from getting injured.

do not, I repeat, DO NOT do the same mistake my Parents and I did with me.I was in a similar situation at 16 with my Dad willing to cough up some dough for a new car, but he put a dollar limit and I had to cover the rest. The dollar limit was a big mistake because it made me think I had to go American to get the most ""bang for my buck."" And heck, it should be cheaper, there is less shipping costs right? :P Anyway, I was thinking horsepower, and fuel economy. I should have been thinking reliability, long term quality, and resale!With the lower dollar limit and my not having much money of my own, and thinking I just had to have a NEW car (a used Civic would have been a MUCH better choice, possibly literally a hundred times better choice!). So instead of getting a 2 or 3 year old Civic I got a new '95 Dodge. Wow, what a mistake. Do not do the same to your daughter. The few thousand you save now will be gone by year 4 in repair costs and tow truck services. Furthermore, she will be stranded multiple times, which is probably worse for a female than a male.Lastly, when she goes to trade it in or sell it privately, she'll curse you and hate you forever when she gets peanuts and sees that the same year Honda is selling for $5-7,000 dollars still. So not only have you spent thousands extra in repair bills vs. the Honda or Toyota, and hundreds in tow truck costs, but then you get the final knockout punch in terrible resale value. Also there is the fact that 10% of the year your car is in the shop. Which means she'll be borrowing yours.Happened to me.... since my Dodge was worth nothing, and I was still in college and poor, I had to ""borrow"" that 95 Camry of my parents for a few years until I got on my feet after college. That Camry ran fine and didn't cause me any problems. Parents took it back when I bought 03 Accord Coupe and used it for even a few more years. Then they sold it at like 120K miles for 3,500 dollars.

I have to agree with andre3 regarding this topic.When I went to college in 2000 my parents put a $15,000 limit for me to choose a car. Instead of a brand new compact or domestic I choose a 1997 Honda Accord LX with 36,000 miles on it. When I graduated from grad school in 2006, it had 120,000 miles on it. I handed it to my sister after purchased my current ride (an IS350 :blush: ) and it is still running strong as we speak. During the 6-year period I had the car, besides the routine maintenance the only other unexpected costs are 1. replace the alternator and 2. replace the radiator. Never had any problem with the engine or transmission and this is for imidazol97... I did drive it pretty aggressive  .With my and my family's own experience, combine with andre3's horror story I just can't come up with a single reason why should I go with anything else other than a Honda or Toyota.

Seven years ago I might have gone the used Accord route also. But now it's 2007 and the mid-sized sedan market is much different, with many fine choices. For example, when I was at the Mazda dealer the other day having my van serviced, I noticed that the no-haggle price on a 2007 Mazda6i Special Value Edition (17"" alloys, sport package, CD changer, power seat etc.) was about $16k. Great looking car, great driving car, brand new, full factory warranty, free oil changes for life (from this dealer). I've seen Milans and Fusions advertised at $15k recently, and Sonatas under $14k. So nowadays I'd tend to go the new car route if I had $15-16k to spend on a car, unless I needed something above the mid-sized sedan class e.g. a minivan (which btw I bought used as a 2002 last year for only $12.5k with a 100k bumper-to-bumper zero-deductible warranty, MSRP was twice that, and the interior looked like the van had never been driven).

Yes, Honda and Toyota were forced to increase their powertrain warranties from a paltry 3 years/36k miles to 5 years/60k miles to get closer to what the competition is offering. If the Accord and Camry are better built than the competition, and as rock-solid reliable as you claim, then increasing the powertrain warranty (even the bumper-to-bumper warranty) would cost Honda and Toyota nothing, but would reap benefits in having the best-backed cars in the mid-sized class. Imagine an Accord with a 10-year, 150,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 20-year, 300,000 mile powertrain warranty--transferrable of course. Toyota could do the same with the Camry. What great selling tools! Honda and Toyota could even get away with eliminating incentives on the Accord and Camry, maybe even raise prices some, because of the value of these long warranties. At no extra cost to Honda and Toyota. Why do you suppose they haven't taken this easy step to demonstrate in a big way that they have a huge lead on their competition in reliability, while increasing their profits on the Accord and Camry (and their other vehicles)?

It is a fact, plain and simple. Sonata has the room of a large car. That is the EPA class it is in. It has more interior room than any other car we are discussing here. That advantage allows the Sonata to grab the #1 spot in fuel economy for large cars. Large-car interior room for a mid-sized price--and a low mid-sized price at that.

Good thing the warranty has little meaning to you, because the bumper-to-bumper warranty expired some 14,000 miles ago and you have only about 10k miles left on the powertrain warranty.A warranty is an insurance policy. It's appreciated in two ways: 1) peace of mind it provides, and 2) when something breaks. I would have loved to have had a longer warranty when the A/C condenser went out on my Civic shortly after the warranty expired--cost me $900 to fix. A friend of mine just replaced the failed tranny in his Odyssey at about 95k miles. Fortunately, he had invested in an extended warranty up to 100k miles, so he didn't have to pay nearly $3000 out of pocket. You can bet HE appreciated the extra warranty coverage.The fact is, both Honda and Toyota know their cars break, so extending the warranties on the Accord and Camry would cost them big bucks. So they don't do it. "

You are welcome to do your own research, and tell us all about it here, to prove that the information on the EPA web site that I linked to is in error. Until then, the Sonata has at least three ""#1's"", not zero as you asserted:* #1 in large-car fuel economy* #1 in interior volume for all sedans in this discussion* #1 in standard safety features for all sedans in this discussionPower advantage? Who cares. I sure don't. Nor do the majority of mid-sized car buyers who buy cars with four-cylinder engines vs. V6s. 0-60 in 6.6 seconds and a top speed of over 140 mph is way more than I or most people need. "

you are leading the pack in this discussion, man. But with me you're preaching to the choir. I just wonder how you might have done as a trial lawyer!The Hyundai Sonata or the Kia Optima would be my choices in this class. The way I look at it, a long Warranty is a smarter, gutsier move by a car manufacturer. I don't see evidence, at least in my own experience or of other trustworthy sources, that either Hyundai or Kia are squirming out of their responsibilities regarding their end of the Long-Haul Warranty, either.I think in light of all these commendable quality reports it's time for many more Americans to squarsh some reason in to their brains and quit over-hyping the Honda's and Toyota's.

Aren't the 4-cylinder base models of the Fusion (Milan), Altima, Legacy, Accord, Camry, Aura, et al all within a thousand dollars of each other? Perhaps the MSRPs are, but not the actual selling prices. Comparably equipped, the Fusion, Milan, Mazda6 and Sonata sell for thousands less than Camry, Accord, or Altima. I'm not sure where the others fall.For example, as someone posted, you can get the Mazda6 sport value for about $16K. This is comparable to the Accord SE. I believe the Accord SE goes for about $19K.

They have been more like 17k the last couple months as they try to clear out the '07s before the '08s get here.JS is about right, if you check the prices paid forums, the Accord SE is about 19k or so.Incidentally, the VP (previously known as DX) has pw/pl/abs/cc/tilt/split fold seat, etc. Whats missing is rear drums vs discs, rear speakers, sway bars, and the alloy wheels. A livable package for the asking price. If I went that route I would budget $60 to get a leather wheel and shifter, and another $100 to get 6x9s for the parcel shelf and call it a day.I think I would still be more likey to go with the Mazda, however, as a sunroof is available before stepping up to the highest trim level. I think that is the only thing we miss on the Subaru, is we should've stepped up a model for the sunroof and heated seats/mirrors. "

Hello out there. Anyone home? Fusion likely getting the TwinForce DI I4 this time next year for MY09. Edmunds now says 25% better fuel econ which gives us roughly 28 or 29 city and 38 or 39 highway. Plus more power.Sorry to talk about the actual cars (not that I don't drift off topic a lot too) but that's pretty big news I'd say. Will the Accord be able to match or beat that with a regular gas engine? I'm guessing their diesel will but the Fusion Hybrid should beat both.You guys wanted Ford to answer Honda and Toyota.

Sorry but you're beating a dead horse here. This isn't really an opinion to challenge; everything backy presented were facts. Like it or not, the Sonata is a large car, as classified by the EPA.What's more interesting, IIRC, the Sonata is the shortest car (length-wise) vs. the Accord the Camry; it also has the shortest wheelbase of the three, yet, it comes with the most spacious interior (per volume) and trunk space (per cu. ft.). I think the Accent and the Elantra is also each a class up from the rest of the class, similar to the Sonata here.Personally, I tend to believe the actual numbers than what you posted and claimed as the ""truth"".

Why does ford seem to add items over time with their vehicles instead of just releasing them with most of the important items available. Ford knew introducing a new midsize vehicle in 06 a nav system would be needed, std ABS, std side airbags, ect. For 07 ford added AWD, DVD nav, std side airbags, for 08 there adding rear sonar, sync, std abs and stragely no ESC yet. I think these upgrades makes an 06 Fusion seem dated content wise to say the least. Ford needs to start producing vehicles from the start with most of these options available. And i understand ford is addressing shortcomings the fusion has, however when the Accord was new in 03 you could pretty much get every option that the 07 accord has with the exception of VSA on the V6 and other small cosmetic changes. So if i purchased an 03 Accord i wouldnt feel my vehicle is terribly out of date in just 4 short years. "

Nissan went a different route with the cvt. It isn't limited to a mere 6 gears I like the new Altima and applaud Nissan for being different and using the CVT.

CVT is a great technology, but its not for everyone (including myself). Its doesn't have a very long track record, and it seems for some of the manufacturers who offered CVT's before they all seemed to abandon them after only a couple of years. But to Nissans defense i haven't heard much about the CVT equipped Murano's so maybe nissan has cracked the code to build a CVT reliably.Besides with most modern trannys the shifts are undetectable anyway. :P "

0-60 times matter significantly because it is the best indicator of what our 0-60 might take at half throttle, or 1/4 throttle. If it is faster at full throttle, it stands to reason it'll be faster at partial throttle.If it is 1 second faster at full throttle, that does'nt mean the difference wouldn't be even more pronounced at 1/4 throttle, only test drives could tell this.By the way, what is the importance of AWD in an underpowered Fusion?

Why does ford seem to add items over time with their vehicles instead of just releasing them with most of the important items available.This is probably my biggest gripe with Ford. Most of this came from the beancounters where the engineers were forced to pick and choose which features to offer because there either wasn't enough engineering resources to do it or there wasn't enough money left in the vehicle budget. That has been fixed as of last year. The other reason is Ford's new strive for quality. Introducing a lot of new technologies at the same time is risky. Keeping the launch of a new vehicle as simple as possible gives you a higher probability of success. Given the Fusion's reliability and quality achievements I'd say it worked. However, it is frustrating and it gives the Ford detractors too much ammunition. Ford used to think it had to compete on price with high volumes. Fields has said publicly that not's profitable and that they need to is focus (no pun intended) on better vehicles with more options.I was surprised to see the Vista Roof and Navigation available on the Edge day 1. In the past these would have been late additions or MKX exclusive items. The 2009 Flex shows the upgraded Ford interior themes and has all of the expected available options. I expect the same for the 09 Fusion and all new vehicles going forward.If the competition thinks it's business as usual at Ford they're going to be unpleasantly surprised. "

the last time I checked it was more like ""flipping a switch"", so it would either be on or off.Nope. ETC (electronic throttle control) gives you as much (if not more) throttle positions. It is not binary (on/off). The only difference is that ETC sends the requested throttle input to the computer and the computer decides how that translates to actual throttle changes. This allows the computer to better coordinate transmission shifts (as opposed to a physical cable where the computer can only react to throttle input after it happens) and normally allows for smoother operation.

By the way, what is the importance of AWD in an underpowered Fusion? AWD just weighs it down making it turn into a tank and gas hog.I won't spend my whole day trying to correct all the bad info you've spouted, but AWD helps in cornering too. It's much easier to get on the throttle quicker at the apex. And since pretty much any engine in this class can get wheel spin from a standing start, AWD also helps make sure all available power gets to the ground rather than just providing tire smoke. Of course there are the advantages of traction in slippery conditions which are much more than just snow... living in the great northwest, I have lots of experience with rain and AWD is very reassuring to have when there is rain. The car I have is not AWD, but my last car, a Subie, did. Although it had about the same HP as my Accord, it handled much much better in the areas that I mention above. When I test drove a Mazdaspeed6 which has AWD along with much more power, I took it on a route that I often go when I want to have some fun on curvy roads so I am very familiar with how my non-AWD car handles there. The AWD version of the Mazda6 was much quicker coming out corners even though it is quite a bit heavier. In the end, AWD just offers more grip and if and when you like to have a little fun, traction is always a good thing. "

Here is the senario. I rented a 2006.5 Kia Optima (30K miles showing) LX 2.4 liter 4 cylinder 5 speed automatic. I drove this car about 1000 miles exactly over 2 days with 4 adult passengers and all our luggage. Route of travel included driving west to the far south western corner of Ohio from western Pa. Here are my observations:1.The car was comfortable...quiet..rode smoothly with plenty of room in the rear (at least my normally outspoken mother-in-law was quiet). It handled the Laurel Highland portion of the drive on the Pa Turnpike (moderately curvy) fine at speed although this portion WAS smoothed out for more gentle turns by PennDot.2.Power wise it cruised the whole trip at 75mph including mountainous terrain and rarely shifted out of 5th. It fairly jumped off the line and reved freely through about 5K RPM (remember my MIL was in the back) when entering on ramps to cruise speed. No problems there. Additionally at idle it was imperceptable (so this may be engine refinement?) and quiet on acceleration and at cruise speeds. 3. I refilled the tank twice...refill #1 was around 12.3 gallons with 384 miles showing on the trip odometer = 30.8 mpg (approx)...refill #2 was at our start point on the return with 409 miles showing since the previous refill. I can't remember the gallons used, but calculated to 29.9 mpg at the time. Both refills occurred with approx. 1/4 tank remaining so fuel economy was good with 4 passengers and my driving speed (75 mph most of the time).4. I particularly liked the steering wheel controls for the radio. The Ac was on almost all of the trip and was COLD cooling even the rear seat area without rear mounted HVAC vents. 5. Final observations...I liked it quite a lot but being a low end rental I would upgrade models if purchased and given the choices on engines in Optima's I would opt for the 4 verses the 2.7 V-6.I found I needed another rental urgently this week (transmission on our 1995 187K mile Dodge Stratus died..is this a sign of inferior domestic quality?) and was given a 2007 Ford Fusion ""S"" 4 cylinder with 5.5K miles. A few observation on it as compared to the Optima.1.high rear deck/trunk obscures rear vision, for me anyhow.2. VERY noisy engine (induction noise?) AND exhaust noise on acceleration. Engine noisier at idle.. busy mechanical noises(not knocking) but you know it is running unlike the Optima.3. Sluggish normal acceleration without ""getting into it"" as compared to the Optima. But if you do get into it it seems OK but still ""feels"" slower than the Optima... measured numbers aside.4. Taunt ride and sharper handling.5. missing nice touches standard on the low level Optima..steering wheel radio controls for example. Since I have only had the Fusion a day or so I will form other opinions I am sure and I'll let you know. But for now here is one. The Optima is a car where I was sure I was doing about 70 mph only to find I was doing 80 whereas the Fusion is one where I was sure I was doing about 70 mph only to find I was doing 60. "

Gated shifter is just my own preference. I feel it's a easier way to shift because one doesn't have to first press a button then move the shifter. That's a 2-step process versus gated shifter's one.

On top of that I think it looks better. Agree. When I bought my mazda6 I did not think much of it...I could take it or leave it. Then I realized there was no button, so now I prefer the gated style...not that the lack of one would be a deal-breaker. "

I actually care about the ""look"" more than the ""feel"" I know cheap when I see it, and I know good quality when I see it.

For example CR routinely measures well below the EPA numbers because they do a very severe city driving test. CR typically measures about 13-15 mpg city, for these midsize sedans with V6.EPA test of AWD Fusion is now at 17 mpg. Without AWD the V6 is at 18 mpg, which is exactly the same as the Accord.

In retrospect, we should have bought an SEL I4 Fusion but this $27,105 MSRP baby was on the lot, in stock and had everything that we wanted on it.The difference between 14.8 mpg and 17 mpg is about $252 a year, based on 10,000 miles driven, our average, with gasoline at $3 a gallon.With the exception of the poor gasoline mileage, our Fusion is an exceptionally fine mid-size sedan.

Do report more review news on driving the Fusion, indeed, OK?I think this comment from targettuning sums some things up nicely.""Since I have only had the Fusion a day or so I will form other opinions I am sure and I'll let you know.

By contrast, and as noted in my report, the Hyundai/Kia 4 cylinder is MUCH quieter both at idle and especially on acceleration light and heavy (the Kia makes some induction noise at heavy acceleration) where the Ford sounds like a 70's muscle car with no air cleaner.

Our car has 9K miles and the driver seat bolster has the pattern on the cloth fabric wearing off...going-going-soon to be gone in a 3 X 2 inch patch where our ""butts"" contact it on entry and exit.

Here we go. This CR report can lead into a whole new discussion about the objectivity of CR. (I quit reading CR 30 years ago because of what I felt was a big bias against certain manufacturers, so I can only go by what others say today about CR.)I've driven my '05 Sonata over 1300 miles from south Florida to CT in two days (just me in the car). It was comfortable and certainly not ""floaty."" Drove it 40 miles each way to a golf course yesterday with 2 other guys, and our golf bags and other golf equipment in the trunk. Again, it drove and rode beautifully. My brother has an '07 Sonata and has taken a few round-trips of 300 to 400 miles.

I'd have to agree the Sonata is not ""floaty"" by any stretch. Compared to say an Impala I had to suffer with, it has a much more advanced suspension in that it's supple and firm. It handled the small to medium large bumps really well; composed and you felt a bump only once. On bigger bumps, I felt like there was more an ""event"", moreso than in my 6 which was surprising since the mazda's ride is more firm. Maybe it was just I felt more of the bump through the steering rack, but on large bumps I definately felt more in the Sonata. And in cornering the Sonata had quite a bit more body lean than my Mazda, but then again, everything else in this class does. Compared to the Legacy, Accord and Altima (last gen), I think the Sonata had a bit more body lean, but still I had more confidence in corners than the Altima which just felt top-heavy and bloated to me. Really, the Accord and Sonata are about equal in terms of feel with the edge for taughtness and balance going to the Accord by a small margin. "

Consumer Reports has to justify their ratings, which are comprised of various acceptable and unacceptable and legitimate and illegitimate criteria. Argue all you want about what car is best, which tends to be a blend of subjective and specification issues. What is good for one is not good for all. But! I have rented several different mid-size models and I have extended family members that own an Accord, Sonata and Camry. Having rented a Grand Prix, Altima, Optima and 6 that pretty much covers the ball-game with the exception of the very competent Fusion and Aura. I was impressed with the powertrain and competent handling of the Sonata. Listen, I need a car not a (NAS)car or (Formula 1)car. I do want something that gives me bang-for-the-buck more than I need a badge that some need to escalate their image because their self-image is based on material possession and peoples perception of them. All of these vehicles had appeal. Dads Accord: 70,000 miles. Issues: one electrical issueMom's Sonata: 40,000 miles. Issues: nilBro's Camry: 50,000 miles Issues: nilThere wasn't one rental I didn't like. The Altima and Grand Prix were the best handling cars with the Grand Prix being the winner but having poor fuel mileage in the 2.5. The best all-round car I have rented in this class was the Altima. It was just a good handling, good riding and enjoyable car. Would I buy it, no! Why: I'm not convinced of parent company Renault and Father Ghosn's approach to quality. It has gone down since I owned 2nd and 3rd Gen. MaximasIf I were buying a mid-size car, I would buy the Hyundai Sonata Limited. I had a an 07 Limited last week with gorgeous black leather interior and loaded. I was told I could buy one for $21-22k with rebates and discounts. Go drive anything out there for $21k and you wont get anything like Hyundai offers in the Sonata. See for yourself. "

While CR might not hold a lot of weight for you or me, it provides much useful input for a lot of people. The fact that Accord sales are through the roof and it consisently gets rated very highly in spite of it's flaws, ie, expensive, no stability control, overrated, bad brakes etc. shows the general public does not have the same views as edmunds board hounds.

As a 2007 Accord LX 5-speed owner for 5 months and 6k miles now, I can respond to some of the recent comments about the Accord.Interior plastics- as targettuning mentioned, ""soft touch"" plactics do have a downside. While the Accord's plastic feels wonderful and doesn't scratch very easily, it has taken a few slight marks from my Labrador which the ""hard"" plastic in my old Ford easily shrugged off. It is a tradeoff between comfort and durability.Traction control (4 cylinder)- this isn't really necessary once you get used to the car. I've gotten the hang of launching quickly but cleanly on dry surfaces, but wet surfaces are much harder. Basically, all most traction control systems do is cut power when wheelspin is detected, something I can do myself. Limited slip would be nice and would help much more, but also isn't necessary in this car.ESC (4 cylinder)- I've tested the handling probably as far as I ever will and found it to be very satisfactory. However, I could see the value in having ESC there ""just in case."" I had a 1991 Mazda 626 that did not have ABS, and got myself into a situation which ABS would have likely saved me from. "

You are correct if the Accord doesn't have something it is for a reason and the reason is... MONEY. They are cheaping out, leaving off useful..but non government mandated(yet)safety features. One can get a MUCH better equipped sedan for less. Same goes for the Civic. They are both priced at the ragged edge (upper edge)for their size class. Wave the Honda ""H"" at consumers and they are like Pavlov's dogs slobbering to buy one based on previous reputation (deserved or not). I did. Same for used car buyers who would rather buy a used Civic or Accord with expired or nearly expired warranty (I know, never would be needed) and X amount of miles than a new ""something else"" that may have more comfort and safety features, no miles and long warranty (I know it probably will be OVER used).

Every manufacturer is going to have some lemons. I also admit that the quality gap does appear to be closing. Hyundai is one I have been really impressed with lately, from reading reviews and reports plus having driven an Azera. However, they still have major problems convincing the public of their quality and adding value behind their brand name.From my experience and the experience of my immediate family, what makes the most difference between Honda/Acura and Toyota/Lexus versus some other makes is how the manufacturers and most dealers stand behind their products. I can speak on behalf of Honda and Toyota in that they really want you to be a satisfied owner.I can't say the same for Ford, once again based soley on my personal experience. I don't have any experience with Hyundai.  "

The radiator, suspension system (upper control arms, sway bar links), brake system (master cylinder, clutch slave) and engine electrical system (3rd distributor) have had issues though. I would say after 10 yrs/100k or so you are on borrowed time, so stuff that happens after that isn't the car's issue.On the up-side, 30 mpg in mixed driving on the last tank ain't so bad. And again, I don't think the car is that bad or anything, its just fun when the Honda sales guys would come over to help me out of my ""unreliable Ford"" when I was there to pay for the towing on the Honda.The Contour did leave me stranded once, for a $400 waterpump at 120k.

Hyundai is not reducing their profit margins by including all of these features out of the goodness of their hearts; they are doing so as a method to increase sales.

Over the past two days, my wife and I have finally been able to go out and actually test-drive a few vehicles that she's considering. The vehicles are listed in the order we tested them:'07 Altima 2.5S (6 speed manual with convenience plus package): To be totally honest, I was VERY surprised at this combination from Nissan. The interior is head-and-shoulders above the previous-gen, both in fit-and-finish, and the quality of materials. The seats were very comfortable, and there's plenty of room for tall drivers like myself. The drive itself was excellent. The 4-cyl has more than enough go when it's loaded with 4 adults and A/C at full blast. The 6-speed was smooth, and easy to modulate, as well as the clutch. The steering was a little light for my tastes, and cornering still isn't close to the standard that the Mazda6 sets (IMO). All in all, a remarkable improvement from the previous-gen model.'07 Altima 3.5SE V6(6-speed manual with sport package): Yes, it's 95 more HP than the 2.5, and yes, it's noticeable especially during acceleration, but I still felt a little torque-steer here and there, and the difference between this and the 2.5 isn't nearly as large as I thought it'd be. Yes, the 3.5 goes like stink, but the 2.5 is no slouch, especially with the 6-speed. Overall, it still felt heavy compared to both the 2.5 (obviously) and my Mazda6 (V6 with 5-speed manual), and the handling wasn't there either.After both drives, my wife preferred the 2.5, for the gas mileage, the use of regular fuel, and the $4K price difference, which she feels that the 3.5SE wasn't worth.'07 Ford Fusion SE V6 AWD: We didn't drive it, but after sitting in it, my wife wasn't impressed, saying that the interior looked and felt cheap. The SEL may have been better, but there wasn't one in sight, so we left.'07 Mercury Milan Premier V6 AWD (with moonroof): Compared to the Fusion, this was MUCH nicer to both my wife and me. Better materials, fit-and-finish, and the overall layout was very nice. The drive was good, very good in fact. The ride was VERY smooth, and the power from the V6 wasn't near the Nissans V6, but it still pulled well, even with AWD. And according to my wife and me, the NVH of the Milan was no better or worse than the Nissans.'07 Honda Accord EX (4-cylinder, 5-speed manual): Another nice ride, with great fit-and-finish, and quality materials. My wife wasn't impressed with the controls for the radio and HVAC arranged as they were. The 4-cylinder performed well with the 5-speed, and was SLIGHTLY quieter than Nissans 2.5. The steering is too light and the brakes felt soft, but the handling was pretty good.So far, she's torn between the 6-speed 2.5 (with it's fuel economy and features for the price) and the Milan V6 AWD (for the nice interior materials and fit-and-finish, and the AWD). Right now, her biggest decider is whether or not she can trade in the fun of a manual for the AWD that is needed in this climate (driving through winters in upstate NY, with over 150"" of snow per year, and lake-effect events that almost happen instantaneously). And yes, she CAN have the best of both worlds with the Subaru Legacy, but we've yet to try it out, and plan to within the coming days. I'll keep you posted.  "

Not having a smooth shifting transmission won't kill you--literally. Not having side airbags, or collapsible steering column, or ABS, or maybe even ESC could kill you, or a loved one.

Presumably this was a market based decision on the part of Ford and/or the dealers. Some people don't want to pay $500 extra to have ABS, just as some do not want to pay $500 extra for ESC. You did have the option to order what you wanted or keep looking to find it. That is not the case for ESC on the Accord, if you wanted it you had to buy an expensive trim level.Don't take this the wrong way. I am certainly not tryng to say Ford has a perfect record in this regard at all, but for this particular point about ESC in the Accord vs. ABS in the Fusion, Ford did the right thing and Honda did not.

Wait a minute, can you even get ESC in a Fusion?It's not about trim levels or options in the Accord, more about engine choice; it is standard with V6 models. Honda actually considers the SE-V6 to be a lower trim level than the EX-I4. Both the LX and SE V6 models can be had for less than an EX-L I4 with nav.Couldn't the fact that the I4 has better weight distribution and thus better handling have something to do with it? "

After driving the Fusion a few more days a couple of new things become apparent.1. I previously stated the Fusion was missing some nice touches the Optima had and used steering wheel radio control as an example. I have found a few more. The Fusion ""S"" dash/instrument cluster does not feature a handy menu of functions like: average MPG...miles to empty (current tank)...outside temperature...or even a dash display showing what gear it is in. Speaking of gears.2. the Fusion shift quadrant has only P..R..N..D..and L. No Hyundai/Kia Shiftronic manumatic shifter for sure. I am not sure what would happen if I shifted from D to L at speed. I suppose it would NOT go immediately into low..hah! I know these ""shift it yourself"" automatics may fall into gimmic land for some but even though I only used it once on our trip with the Optima (demonstrated its function for my wife)it is one of those ""nice touches"" in my book.3. I like the rubbery touch material used on the door panels and dash. The Optima had this material scattered around the interior too.4. I don't like the very low and far to the left headlight switch and I don't like the lack of ""auto-off/auto-on"" headlamps. The Optima low end model also had this.5. I continue to notice the engine induction noise and raspy exhaust and now think it is primarily induction noise. Very noisy throughout acceleration range.6. The Fusion has an Euro type short stick roof mounted radio antenna which seems to work well but the radio itself is not easy to use while driving (I know) with a lot of fussy buttons and controls and that lack of wheel mounted radio controls become even more missed. 7. For some reason the Fusion seem to be a more massive car to me. I don't think it is physically much, if at all, larger than the Optima so why this would be?? Don't know.So, while I like the sharp handling/taunt ride of the Fusion it is off-set by an immensely noisy engine.As of right now I would not buy the 4cyl for that reason alone. Taking a road trip tomorrow..fuel economy numbers to come as well as longer drive perceptions. "

I'm not convinced of parent company Renault and Father Ghosn's approach to quality. It has gone down since I owned 2nd and 3rd Gen.

Just when i thought GM was finally starting to get it right, i scramble upon this:The powertrain is similar to the Saturn Aura Green Line hybrid sedan, and new 2008 EPA figures have mileage rated at 24 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway. These figures aren&#146;t as high as other hybrids, like the Toyota Camry, but it does achieve better mileage than the standard four-cylinder Malibu &#151; by 2 mpg &#151; while producing more power. While the 2008 Malibu will offer a six-speed automatic transmission for the standard gasoline-powered four-cylinder, the hybrid will feature only a four-speed automatic transmission.With only a 2mpg gain and an outdated 4sp auto this car seems doomed before it even goes on sale. Who is gonna pay a premium over a 4cyl malibu which only has 2mpg less than the hybrid and also features a 6sp auto? "

One of the Ford guys can correct me if I am wrong but I think the limitation is that the Fusion has 3 channel ABS vs 4 channel (it looks at the rear wheels together) so there is no functionality to individually control the rear brakes.

So it is better for Ford to offer ABS as a standalone option on all trim levels, and not offer ESC at all on any trim, than it is for Honda to include ABS as standard on all trims and include ESC as standard on all V6 models??? What it is, is obnoxious to make a safety feature available only on higher priced models, for no good reason. It is unfortunate that apparently Ford chose not to design the Fusion with ESC availability in mind, which seems to be the reason it is not offered at any trim level, based on the 3 channel ABS comment someone made. It is obnoxious for Honda to design the Accord so that ESC can be available, but then say you can only have this great new safety feature if you pay up for a V6 that you do not want.Similarly, to the extent AWD is a safety feature, I think it is obnoxious of Ford to only have this available on the V6 models. OTOH, AWD is not available on any Accord so it was an accross-the-board design decision to not have AWD on the Accord which is different from saying you can only have it with some other upgrade. "

The cars that run off the road during snowy conditions in CT are usually SUV's. The drivers have a false sense of security, thinking AWD will keep their car under control.Many SUVs have 4WD not AWD, a slightly different, more archaic system which requires manually activating the transfer case and second drive axle. I don't think there is any requirement to have all the wheels driven for someone to be foolish with an SUV. There may be some self selection criteria in that demographic.In my experience, the first ones in the ditch after a snow are conversion vans (sometimes I think Ohio state troopers park vans on the side of the road at odd angles to remind people to slow in bad weather), followed by high horsepower rear drive vehicles. When I start to see cars discussed in this forum that don't have southern/out-of-state plates in ditches, I get more concerned.And a small caveat, AWD will help with turning, as it transfers power to the outside wheels on a turn, providing better turn-in and rotation. It optimizes traction, as opposed to DSC which just lowers the limits of the vehicle. "

The 2008 Accords won't be out until probably Sept and I suspect that with a new design, ESC will be included with some if not all 4 cyclinder Accords. I read in CR that the Subaru stability control is ""slow to react"" so I don't know how effective that system is.

I do find that AWD does more than just help in wet or slippery weather; it also helps handling. As far as mpg is concerned, I did find that my 2.5 liter in my subie (an automatic) was a bit thirsty as I am now getting the same or better mpg in my v-6 mazda6 (manual tranny).

I have read that some systems are overly invasive...was it the Sonata or Camry (or both) that some had commented about in this regard???We have a VW with ESC (they call it ESP). Theirs seems like a good system (not to quick to intrude) from our experience and from what I have read of it. I would guess that cars that are more oriented toward being a ""driver's car"" will be more likely to perhaps have better (less invasive) systems. I would put include cars like the Mada6, Accord, and Fusion in that category and I guess Legacy is going more in that direction...but I guess we will see over time what type of systems they end up with. As ESC becomes universal, the differences will probably be highlighted in reviews...CR may have the opposite view from reviewers at Edmunds (for example) as to which systems are better. "

""And a small caveat, AWD will help with turning, as it transfers power to the outside wheels on a turn, providing better turn-in and rotation. It optimizes traction, as opposed to DSC which just lowers the limits of the vehicle.""Your statement is mostly incorrect. A 4WD system such as QuadraDrive can help with turning, because QuadraDrive can deliver almost all torque to one wheel (not counting when the transfer case is locked). And unlike AWD QuadraDrive can aid in slowing the vehicle down. AWD in general (not including SH-AWD) delivers power to front and rear to all four whells and does not help with turning because it can not compensate for wheels that slip. (excepting those cars, which have LSDs on the rear)DSC does not lower the limmits of the vehicle, it makes sure you don't exceed the limits of the vehicle, which is a different story. In addition, it attempts to keep the car moving in the direction of the front-wheels by activating brakes individually on 4 channel systems. Something the driver cannot do.As far as what vehicles end up in the ditch, nobody is immune. The last two years of snow storms, I've seen Lexus, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Hyundai all suffering the same ""ditch"" or run off the road fate.Actually I posted a link about a Subaru-centric test of AWD cars, it's an interesting watch.

Thank you for correct my mis-writing. It has the highest frontal-repair collision cost than most of the cars in this category.

it makes sure you don't exceed the limits of the vehiclemust, by definition, engage at some level lower than that. Otherwise it wouldn't be a 'safety' system at all, would it? Furthermore, our individual abilities to properly control a car at its limits will usually deteriorate as we age, meaning that my reactions, eyesight etc. etc. were all better 20 years ago than they are now. I was a more capable driver then, I am a better driver now. The point being that cars particularly within this category MUST have ESC systems set towards the 'lowest common denominator' driver, that 80-90 year old guy, if you will. Lastly, how else do you explain, reductions in avoidance test capabilities, high speed swerve etc. etc. continually in cars equipped with ESC as opposed to that same car when (and if) the system is turned off. This is becoming a fact of life, so much so that even CR (somebody that obviously would figure to champion systems like this) has begun recognizing in their own tests that stability control does limit cornering/avoidance speed capabilities. Not to mention the enthusiast mags who obviously bump these 'limits' on a regular basis and therefore have coined a term for it - electronic 'nannies'.This is a dangerous trail we're on, as we encourage some computer nerd and/or liability lawyer determine what you, I and everybody else is capable of behind a steering wheel. You don't suppose that those same lawyers would be lined up for miles when my throttle is cut, my brakes are applied for me etc. (SC system controls are largely passive (not aggressive) in nature) and the car I'm in won't allow me to avoid an accident (ostensibly because IT doesn't think it is safe), while I think (of course) that I could have handled it quite nicely on my own), do you?

I think you have a misconception about this IIHS study on repair costs. It's all about repair costs from different kinds of collisions. So warranties have absolutely nothing to do with it. It also has little to do with out-of-pocket costs, assuming someone has collision insurance with a a deductible under about $750. It could affect those collision insurance costs, of course--the study was done by an insurance industry group, after all.One of the interesting tidbits in the IIHS report is that some mid-sized cars like the Camry actually did quite poor on certain tests, e.g. the full rear-end test, when you look at how much damage they suffered, but because parts costs are relatively low for the Camry, the cost to repair the damage was not as great as for some cars that suffered less damage.I agree that people don't buy on warranty alone. I sure don't. But given the choice between two mid-sized cars that meet all of my other requirements, I'll buy the one that has the longer warranty that matches my driving and ownership pattern best.

 Why do you keep saying this? None of the wheels are totally unloaded unless they're off the pavement. The inside wheels will have a little less weight than the outside wheels in a turn but they are nowhere near ""totally unloaded"".Then the vehicle is not cornering at its limit, so having something that intervenes at this point is certainly not raising the handling limits of the vehicle. On a stock, squishy car like the vehicles discussed here, there is enough body roll, weight transfer, and suspension travel that at the limit there is little or no weight on the inside wheels.I think DSC/ESC *may* improve the capabilities of certain drivers, but electronics can only compensate so much. It's main safety feature is that it applies the brakes so at least the vehicle will be going slower at the point of collision. "

No. My preference for my next new car is one that scores Good/Good/Good on the IIHS crash tests. None of those cars you listed do that as of now.

I don't think the Camry is worth the price premium for what you get, and I'm not crazy about the styling. On the Fusion, I prefer the Milan, and I would seriously consider the Milan if I slip my crash test requirement. On the Sonata, I'd like to see what Hyundai comes up with for the 2009 refresh.

Of course, DSC limits cornering, but it also helps avoid spinouts.This is exactly my point, it makes the vehicle ""safer"" for most, poorly trained, inattentive drivers by lowering the overall limits of the vehicle.As I was reading Grassroots Motorsports (one of the greatest car rags ever) there was an article on young people involved in autocross and other entry level events of driving skill. In one of the editorials, the author pointed out that you don't ""lose control of a car, you give it up."" Apparently, so many drivers are giving it up, we will now have a computer to take over. "

It would be my luck to buy one of those eBay Accords with 100,000 miles and have it implode at 100,001, right after I drove it away.I've owned many, many cars in my 49 years of driving but I've never owned one with 100,000 miles. My 2000 Ford Focus station wagon has 93,000 miles on it so it may be the first. That's one of the reasons why we bought a Fusion for our mid-size sedan, good results with the Focus and with a 1997 Ford Thunderbird, 85,000 miles.Even so, Bender, your Accord research was quite enlightening. It would seem at first blush that the Accords take a lickin' and keep on tickin'. "

It's just a 2008 Fusion, which is the same, appearance-wise, as the 2006 and 2007 Fusions. No styling changes. But the renderings for the 2009 reveal quite a few changes, including the loss of the bottom chrome bars and a new taillight setup.I believe FoMoCo is serious about becoming a stalwart competitor in the mid-size segment again, as is GM. Chrysler doesn't seem to have a serious contender in this category. "

There is a lack of personal accountability here, one doesn't lose control, they give up control, most often because they lack driving skill. This is an issue with people driving a vehicle beyond their skill level, at which point it would be more effective to activate the brakes on all 4 wheels. There may be times when the car will not follow exactly the wishes of the operator, but that doesn't mean or even imply that the driver has no control over the vehicle.Suddenly, if they say ""oh, it wasn't my fault, I lost control"" that makes it all better.

That my friend is a ""loss"" of control. If you don't have TOTAL control, you have LOST some control. You may be able to regain control, but it may be too late.Control isn't digital, its not something you have or you don't. In racing, there are many times when you cannot get the vehicle to do exactly what you want, either because of picking a bad line, carrying too much speed, another vehicle in the way, etc, but amazingly, the driver can keep the vehicle on the road and out of anyone else's fenders.There is no collision avoidance application in DSC. It lowers the limits of the vehicle to match the abilities of the driver. Is a car with lower limits safer in the hands of the general public? Probably. The original argument was if these systems would improve handling, and I think consensus is now that they won't, although they may improve safety.It seems these ""electronic nannies"" can improve lap times for F1 drivers, but obviously these guys can't hold a candle to your abilities.While I appreciate your acknowledgment of my incredible driving prowess, I would also like to point out that the systems used in F1 (since they are definitely applicable to mid-sized sedans) can vary suspension rates as well as pre-load the sway bars. That, my fellow Honda loving friend, would improve handling. This is not such a new concept, Citroen did it on their mid-sized sedan in the 60s, and a number of vehicles have used electronic systems to vary the amount of dampening. The systems being discussed currently will just brake.Vehicles like the BMW 7-series (just for you kdshapiro) have electronically adjusted sway bars that can limit body roll and weight transfer. Given the weight of the BMW is about 2x that of my Accord, I think the car handles remarkably well, and this electronically adjusted suspension is a big part of it. Will your $18k Accord have the same system as the $100k BMW, I am gonna guess no, but I think I was wrong before once or something :P "

I was nothing special to Honda, other than being a younger man up and coming in the world with a lot of future vehicle purchases in my lifetime to come. It was my first Honda, that 2003 Accord.

I would assume Honda treats all of their customers at least as good as they did to me, but I was somewhat aggressive and demanding with my dealer. They can't say no if you don't ask. It's when they say no and you've asked politely that you should get mad and raise hell. Looking back, I should have gotten a big sign and picketed the Dodge dealer right in front of them on the sidewalk until they offered to pay for my AC repair and head gaskets, and auto tranny, and 15 other things. Alas... I didn't take the time or think it might work, howeverI have a coworker that told me he picketed Carmaxx in front of their sales lot, and after about day 5 doing it, everyday for all day, they caved in and bought back his 10 month old Windstar sp?? Ford for 100% of his purchase price. The only conditions they gave him for buying it back at full price were that he never shop or buy from CarMax again  "

Funny you should pick Taurus to point out how poor domestics are. Directly prior to purchasing the 95 Stratus from my daughter we owned about, lets see, 7 Taurus/Sables from 1986 to 1988 model years. All bought used. The longest lived was the 1987 wagon sold two years ago this Thanksgiving. It had 293,435 miles when sold and I still see it occasionally on the road around town. Yes, it did have a reman. transmission installed @ around 190K miles. Yes I did repair/replace things on it in the 13 years I owned it (from 132K miles to 293K miles). The next was a 1987 LX sedan that was sold to a friends son @ about 190K miles. It NEVER had the transmission replaced up to the point he was rear-ended at around 200K miles thus ending the cars useful life. The last higher mileage was a 1986 Sable wagon that went to 150K miles. Original transmission replaced @132K miles...salvage yard replacement lost reliable OD and was not remaining in it when sold. All had the ""Vulcan"" V-6 and NONE required any engine work (except water pumps, alternators etc) and NONE used oil or ran poorly regardless of mileage. I spent $$ on most of them for mostly normal repairs. Some had odd things go wrong and some (one comes to mind) was a money pit that vexed me until I repaired/replaced almost all electrical items e.g. power window motors..pwr. lock actuators...AC problems...auto climate control etc. but ran flawlessly otherwise.

I have been noting my perceptions on a 2007 Fusion ""S"" 4 cylinder 5 speed automatic. Originally I was comparing it to a 2006.5 Kia Optima since I almost literally jumped out of the Kia into the Fusion. Now as I have driven the Fusion more and on a weekly repeated trip of a little over 300 miles I will say more.1. The initial observation of a noisy engine (induction noise as opposed to mechanical clanks) remains. It also has, I believe, raspy exhaust but I can't hear much over the engine.2. After driving in the Allegheny mountains I confirm initial observations of sluggish acceleration/ and or slow speeds up those mountains with the same four adults (less luggage) as was in the Optima last week. The Optima fairly flew up those same mountains and remained in at least 4th gear whereas the Fusion needed a downshift to 3rd to maintain speed once gained ( and that seemed to be more of a struggle).3. I find I dislike even more the high rear package shelf/trunk as time passes. Sometimes when I crest a hill the car behind me is momentarily lost from sight as the rear rises on the downside of the hill. Additionally backing into a parking stall is difficult when you cannot see ""behind"" well. 4. The car feels larger than it probably is..upright and tall like a Ford crossover SUV. It feels solid (5K miles however) rides firmly and corners and tracks pretty well also. 5. Now for fuel economy. 345 miles @ 13 gallons = 26.538 mpg. This was unlike the trip using the Optima so I won't directly compare to it but it WAS typical of a week-end trip using our 1995 Dodge Stratus...same terrain, same route, same speeds, same load (4 adults no luggage). The Stratus for those who do not know has 187,500+ miles a 4 speed auto 2.5 liter V-6 (164 hp) which compares favorably with the 4 cylinder/5 speed auto Ford. The Stratus generally gets the same/similar or a bit more mpg on these trips (around 27.3- sometimes as much as 28 mpg). I have used it week in and week out for more than a year on this same exact trip so I have more experience with it but I am not really impressed with the Fusion so far. A Hyundai Sonata 4 cylinder/4 speed auto (2006) rented for the same trip a few months ago got (as I recall) about 29.something mpg.I don't know that the V-6 Fusion would do any worse on this type drive. If you factor in the apparent laboring engine of the 4 cyl. in the mountains and additional gear (6 speed auto). I have never driven the V-6 model but since I have this trip every week I might strongly consider it over the 4 if I were to buy a Fusion/Milan. Conversely since I AM considering a Sonata I wonder (after having rented both 4 and V-6) if I really, really need the 6. The 4 cylinder in that car and the Optima is perfectly satisfactory..quick even..on my typical weekly trip..mountains included and seems to get better fuel economy (even the V-6 Sonata got about 29 mpg)!

So far, I've been seeing 28 mpg city / 34 mpg highway in the Accord, average of 30, without even trying to maximize economy (quick starts and heel-toe downshifts in the city, and 70-80 mph highway).After reading an article on MSN about ""hypermiling"" (using various methods to greatly increase economy), I'm going to use this tank of gas to test some of the theories. Most of it is common sense, i.e. avoiding quick starts and excessive idling while stopped, no more than 5 mph over speedlimit or 55 mph, etc. Also, not giving it any more gas on hills, just keeping the throttle open to the same amount as on flat ground, and letting speed fall some. Some of it has surprised me... The last mile of my commute home, if I slip into neutral at a certain point, I'll only have to give it five short pulls from 2,000-2,500 rpms to get into my driveway. The rest of the time I am coasting along just fine at idle in netural. It is also surprising to me how keeping the revs down below 2,500 makes acceleration seem excruciatingly slow to me, yet none of the other traffic seems to mind at all. I don't get passed by many people, and still leave some people behind.A few of the theories are pretty wild, such as shutting of the engine at stoplights and on long downhills, drafting 18-wheelers, etc. I won't be going crazy here, just trying some of the easy stuff for one tank of gas, at least 80% city, to see how much of a difference it makes. Has anybody already tried anything like this? What do you guys think, will it make any difference and if so, will it be worth it? I think I'll see some substantial gains with the coasting. Also, the Accord is the perfect car to try this with, as I can keep the VTEC on the ""economy"" profile. "

That's because no matter what we do our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion only yields a constant 14.8 in all-city driving after seven months and 3,700 miles.The revised EPA estimate (always optimistic) for this power train is 17 mpg city; 24 mpg highway. We did take one 360-mile trip with this car and it averaged 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning driving 65-75 mph.Technicians at our dealership checked the car over with a computer at 1,500 miles and said everything was according to specifications; they found nothing to be ""wrong.""Our terrain is flat. The climate is moderate (air conditioner now in use all the time). The tires are slightly over inflated to 35 psi.

Should I call USA Today so they can start printing the story now?Exactly, baggs. It's just as scientific as deciding which is the best car from 40 consumer reviews at the top of the page. ""Well, car X is rated 9.2, and I like it a lot, but car Y is rated 9.4, so I guess I'll buy that one. It's clearly the best car."" That would be a pretty proposterous proposition(pardon the allitteration!)The Taurus, while not exactly competitive in its last few years, did prove to be of at least average reliability by many accounts.Seems like if I were choosing a domestic to be a bad example of reliability, I would've gone with a 90s Chrysler anyway! :P "

We've seen the interior of the Ford Flex and speculated that the '09 Fusion will get something similar. I have to beg to differ now though. Seems to me it will get something more along the lines of the '08 Focus and Escape interior. See the pic below and note that you can opt for a navigation system in the Escape or the Sync in the Focus, both of which replace the standard radio controls with a 9 inch touch screen unit. The dual zone climate control readouts are in the screen on top of the dash. It's actuall kind of nice when you see it all lit up with the temps and such.

The Focus interior looks very Mazda3 with the display at the top of the center stack instead of with the radio. From a usability standpoint, it makes sense because the display is much closer to the road so in theory it should result in less eyes-off-road time. The downside is when you separate controls from their displays, there are mapping issues and those might be even more prevalent with sync and its capabilities. I think they just expect the driver to use the steering wheel controls. "

Not necessarily. The Focus and Escape interiors were done prior to Fields taking over and from what the insiders tell us the Flex interior is closer to what we'll see on the 09 Fusion (with adjustments for cars vs. CUV, etc.). Remember the Flex will hit the streets next summer before the 09 Fusion. "

I'm surprised at your low highway MPG. I averaged about 32 mpg in automatic mazda6 I4, which is the same engine. This was over a 1600 mile round trip at about 72-77 mph most of the time and A/C on part of the time.I've been getting 23-25 mpg in my normal suburban commute...speed on my route varies from about 30 to 60 mph with an average speed around 40-45 mph. There are quite few stop lights but no congestion. I think the I4 sounds great, at least in the Mazda variation. I don't feel there is excessive engine noise at all. I could do with somewhat less tire noise than the Mazda has on some pavement, though. "

Well, as I said since this was the first time driving the Fusion on this particular trip. And I can't comment on an extended drive as yours that probably included a lot longer time at cruise speed on an interstate/turnpike. I can, however, equate this car to others including my own (the 95 Stratus and a 2006 Civic) on this re-occurring trip that follows the same route..speed (more or less) and load week in and week out. I was somewhat surprised by the fuel economy but I knew about what was coming by the amount of fuel left (per the dash gage)upon return home. Also, I don't really know what Ford was thinking leaving the amount of induction noise intact when designing this. I have not encountered this much noise on a new car...ever! Yeah, there is muted intake/induction noise on other brands but this seems to have been left intact to simulate ""sportiness?"" maybe. It really is unrelenting unless you absolutely are on cruise with no additional acceleration needed. But, accelerate for any reason and it becomes evident again. This may be pleasing to some but it is annoying when it drowns out the radio (low volume to be sure). "

Ford has suffered on fuel economy because Bill Ford's mandate for the last several years has been emissions. Ford has a V6 Explorer that puts out less emissions than a Prius, yet they never advertised it and the public never seemed to care. I always thought that was the wrong focus but it seemed to be a personal thing with Billy. Now the gloves are off and we've seen a hint with the new Taurus having a mileage increase while adding 60 hp with the new 3.5L engine.

Oh, coasting seems harmless enough but what if a powered move becomes necessary? By the time one realizes they are in neutral and remembers to engage drive the need for the powered move has passed..to what harm?? Not for me!It's a manual, I wouldn't shift an automatic into neutral while cruising.My last automatic... if I was cruising along in gear and decided I needed to make a ""powered move"" and punched it, I would get... nothing. The car would hesitate for a moment as if to say, are you serious? Then, the revs would fall as it shifted out of the gear it was in and worked its way down... when it found the gear it wanted, wham! the revs would shoot way back up, and acceleration would begin. Even if I forget I'm in neutral, I can shift into gear and get going as quick as an average slushbox can react to your right foot. "

This past trip we saw 3 doe with 4 fawn in the middle of the afternoon. At night things get worse + bear + bobcat so all kinds of wildlife is around. I hit two deer last fall so I am especially aware with a rental. As a result I drive moderately especially at night.

so, with 20,000 miles and after driving it for 18 months, my car is worth MORE THAN WHAT I PAID FOR IT (using their suggested retail price)!!! And private party value is about $2200 less than what I paid for it. Some were saying resale value is mostly dependent on what car you buy...I would suggest that this piece of information indicates that price paid is a bigger factor. So when a car can be had at a great price (I've heard of Mazda6's selling new for $6k+ below msrp), resale value as a percentage of price paid will be much better than brands who charge a premium for their product. But I should mention that this info is not too important...I plan on keeping this car for quite a while since I really enjoy driving it. For my tastes, it's still the best mix of practicality, attractiveness, performance, safety, and value in this segment. "

you assume that buyers are logical and know how or are willing to do even basic research. a friend of mine who just bought a used xterra spent about as much as a person who could have gotten a new one with more than just 600 miles left on his warranty. why? who knows... but probably he saw the car and justified in his mind that buying used was saving him a lot of money when it wasn't. of course, I didn't have the heart to tell him that he paid too much, but it just goes to show there are a lot of buyers of used cars who don't pay a lot of attention to the prices of new ones. all they see is the big difference between msrp and what KBB says and think they are saving a lot. I'm not saying it's fair that I could sell my 18 month car with only a 10% reduction in price (using KBB's private party value for my car), but that's the way they price it and I'm surely not compaining. But if I were to go back on the market to look for another car that could take the twisties like a mazda6 and could also hold a coffee table fully assembled in the back and look good doing it, I'd be buying another Mazda6.

exactly, car resale values whether it be through a dealer or private party will always be related to what a new version costs on late model cars, and the reason why those values tend to plummet when a particular vehicle starts being rebated and/or sold with bought down finance rates. The KBBs and NADAs of the world have a tough time with current real dollar values esp. at the point that the mfgr has to offer those rebates and other 'deals' to clear their inventories. The only time that I've seen a car 'appreciate' after purchase is when it is hard-to-get and/or in very high demand (the Prius and the Mini come to mind) exactly the opposite of the situation with have with any of the cars in this group (to varying degrees).

In my case I'll likely keep my car for more than 10 years, so it does not really matter, anyway. But even after only 3 years, the difference is about $1000. I think there are very few people who did not save well over $1000 by buying a Mazda6 instead of a comparably equipped Accord. "

Thank you Captain Obvious.Why do you think GM and Ford are cutting back on daily rental fleet sales (GM still has a ways to go but Ford is getting there).One thing to remember is that fleet contracts are usually for a specific number of units done months in advance. So if a vehicle's retail sales volume falls from the previous year then the percentage of fleet sales will go up even though the actual number never changed from what was projected. "

your previous point about monthly numbers being a 'snapshot' is likely right on - think a good portion of these fleet sales has to do with overproduction and inventory levels as well as 'slow' retail sales. So therefore, these percentages should go up and down except in those cases where the mfgr. (by policy) doesn't get involved too much in fleet sales. The unfortunate is that for some of these mfgrs., cutting production to match sales is easier said than done. "

actually, 18 months ago, I had 4k worth of rebates so mazda incentives have been around for quite a while. the fact that these rebates despite being around for many many months aren't reducing the resale in Kelly Blue Book suggests that a heavily discounted car can help protect a buyer from really bad resale values. Either that or a Mazda6 is like wine...it gets better with age :P Or perhaps it speaks to how boring most of the midsize cars have become. I think I'll stick with my original theory... those who have decided to buy a used car don't usually do a lot of research as to what kind of discounts were available when the car was originally bought. I know many people who have bought used cars that were just a couple thousand of what they could have gotten new with much lower interest rates and a longer warranty. Granted, these are a saleperson's dream, but being in sales for quite some time, I know that most consumers are not very well researched and if you try to help them get informed their eyes glaze over. Which is probably why a manufacturer's reputation plays such a big role when it comes to buying cars despite the truth that the reliability between manufacturers differ by only a couple percent over five year periods for most cars in this segment according to consumer reports and JD Powers.

I, for one think much of this has become a ""game"" for the participants. Not so much in managing fuel economy as bragging rights. Also, most of their moves seem downright dangerous to me. I would not attempt most of the things they do....not worth my life for whatever fuel economy gained. Oh, coasting seems harmless enough but what if a powered move becomes necessary? By the time one realizes they are in neutral and remembers to engage drive the need for the powered move has passed..to what harm?? Not for me!Target, I made a short video to show the techniques I'm using to test the max fuel economy of my new Honda (basically slow accelerations with 2500 RPM max, letting speed drop on hills, and a lot of coasting). As you'll see, they aren't really dangerous. I'm keeping up with the slow lane of traffic most of the time. Watch how when I coast, the cars next to me keep going only to have to slam on their brakes shortly after to reduce speed down to the limit or to stop.I this true ""hypermiling""? Maybe. Will I see results that are worth the effort? I don't know. Is driving like this fun? Not really. Will my next video be more exciting? I hope so!The video also shows how smooth and quiet the car is, for those who don't care about fuel economy. Turn up the volume and you can hear the turn signal and barely hear the engine.Maybe when I've burned this tank of gas and thus finished this little experiment, I'll make a video of a full acceleration run so everyone hear can see and hear that experience.Link to video on CarSpace "

those who have decided to buy a used car don't usually do a lot of research as to what kind of discounts were available when the car was originally boughtthis may be true depending on the acumen of the buyer - but also it is true that the vast majority of later model cars are traded in or sold to dealers not sold 'private party' and certainly not at anything close to KBB 'retail'. Those folks will know precisely what you or anybody else likely paid for a car - it is their business to know, and they will base anything they would pay for your car based on that. Rebates do, in fact, reduce any car's resale values as well as its initial cost. Even sold private party, banks have things called 'loan values' that would protect them from loaning too much, so therefore, the chances are that even if you can find somebody to pay a few thousand more than what your car is really worth, the guys with the checkbook are not likely to go along with it.The whole concept of ever getting even close to what you paid for an 18 month old car that is not in high demand anyway, just doesn't happen! But you are welcome to believe your KBB/Edmunds/NADA 'retail' values if you wish, or you can fall prey to that oldest trick in the book, and let the dealer sooth you with a high trade-in allowance on an overpriced newer car.

since you're such an expert on car resale values I'll just call you :surprise: . do you think Kelly Blue Book gives prices that would make the reader happy? and who do you think actually buys Kelly Blue Books? since dealers would be their biggest group of customers, wouldn't Kelly Blue Book be more inclined to print values that are more favorable to them? the point is, Kelly Blue Book is often used as a referrence by buyers, banks, and dealers not because it is often wrong...but because it gives a good guide as to what the market will bear.the biggest thing is, you don't know what I paid for my car nor the discount I got on it. if you are assuming that I just got the 4k rebates and that's it, you'd be wrong. so my argument still stands... if you get a good deal on a car, that will help make depreciation much less of an issue (though to be sure, buying a new car should never be considered an investment). losing 10% in value (based on private party value by KBB) for a Mazda6 that I bought 18 months ago and have put 20k miles on it is amazing which is probably why you're doubting this. but believe it or not, Mazda6's can be had for amazing deals which is probably why the #'s are what they are. in the end though, I like my car way too much to sell it even if the resale value is awesome. it's just another thing to be happy about my Mazda6.

Edmunds hasn't caught up with the effects of that absurd 4 grand rebate yet (and 5 years from now).No offense, but I'm gonna go with the opinion that edmunds knows more about average car prices than you do.There has never been a $4000 rebate on the 2007 Mazda6. The largest rebate has been $2000, so far and is currectly at $1750. Some (but not all) buyers, such as myself, have gotten well below invoice less the rebate...we will experience even less depreciation than the average buyer. Right now edmunds gives a TMV of $18,736, including the $1750 rebate, on my exact car. For the comparable Accord the TMV is $20,614. These figures represent the average buyer's price. The difference is $1900. So my point stands that there are likely very few people who did not save well over $1000 by buying a Mazda6 instead of a comparably equipped Accord...and are likely to experience less depreciation cost (measured in dollars) in the Mazda6 than they would have in the Accord. "

Looks like they are using the same data as I am, the press release says: The ALG&#153; Depreciation Ratings will incorporate ALG econometrics and Edmunds.com's ""True Market Value®"" .This rating is most certainly based on percentages.

I just looked on CarMax (they don't negotiate price, right?), every 2006 Mazda6 in my region is priced higher than what I paid for my 2007. The closest is a base model (so less equipped than mine) priced at $250 more than I paid. "

the 4k number (actually $3750.00) comes from post 3206 and is confirmed by zzoom's claims on what he actually paid for his car quite awhile ago. Since I have not shopped the 6 personally I can't confirm or deny either claim - if true, though , a 20% up front discount on a $20k car puts it about 10% under 'invoice' before the haggling even starts and further will have negative effects on its value down the road. Therefore your $1000.00 savings (should be more than that when compared to even the outgoing 'old' Accord/the 'new' Camry or Altima) may not be savings at all. "

Carmax had several used 2006 Accords on the lot for more than I paid for my brand new 2007. And of course, their prices are ""no haggle."" Does that mean their high-priced Accords won't sell? Of course they will. Would that be a good deal for the buyers? Only if they are happy with that price.I think the important aspect of TMV and ALG ratings is that they use AVERAGE transaction prices.

$250 more than I paid is still $2250 less than what the average buyer is paying for a new one, per edmunds TMV. Many people will be satified with a newish used car, if they believe they are saving a couple thousand bucks over new. The point is that the average residual value that edmunds reports may still be correct, even if it seems to you to be too close to what some buyers paid for a new Mazda6. "

$250 more than I paid is still $2250 less than what the average buyer is paying for a new one.It is really hard to find anybody that doesn't like to at least think they got a better deal than somebody else. This a function of all our egos, and $2200.00 is a lot of extra discount on a car that you are contending that everybody else is paying that much too much for. Suggest that there is more to this story, perhaps a unusual color, option combination, a demo, something that had been on the lot too long, or even a special order car that the dealer already had some money on. If you are going to assume Edmund's TMV (and resale estimates) are even close to accurate (a real stretch IMO in these days of outlandish rebates), then your purchase price seems even more unlikely.

3139,"July 11, 2007 10:42AM","

None of your speculations are correct. The edmunds TMV is what it is, I see no reason to believe it is any more inaccurate for a Mazda6 than it is for an Accord. There is nothing unusual about my car and it had 7 miles on it. There is also nothing that unusual about the price I got, a number of people have gotten similar or better deals, while others have paid significantly more. The fact is that the Accord's higher resale value is offset by its higher purchase price. It does not matter how you figure it. If you start with invoice less rebates, rather than TMV, for the models I looked at that will still show the Accord at about $2300 more than the comparable Mazda6. This is more than double the difference in edmunds predicted value after 3 years. If you don't believe that the initial purchase prices are affected by expected future values, then you must believe that only Accord buyers know about their higher resale values. One who is buying a Mazda6, Ford Fusion, Sonata, or whatever is just as likely to be aware of the higher resale values of Accords and Camrys and therefore will seek to pay significantly less than those cost, in order to offset this difference.

Jeffy,Since you believe Edmunds TMV to be accurate, have you checked the Edmunds TCO or ""True Cost to Own"" figures? They are based off of TMV and include depreciation, financing, insurance, expected maintenance and repairs, etc.Comparing similiar models, Accord LX has the lower TCO at $0.44 per mile versus the Mazda6i SVE at $0.47 per mile.Now, that is a difference of $0.03 per mile, which at 15k miles per year is $450.It is up to the individual consumer to decide if that is significant to them or not.A Malibu LT 4 cyl has a TCO of $0.49 per mile, or $750 /year.

I think the TCO is a useful starting point and guide to what to look at on the financial side, but one should adjust for their own circumstances. For example they show a much bigger difference in insurance costs than I would expect, since I pay less than $450 per year total. I would also adjust for myself based on driving about 1/2 of the miles that edmunds uses.But yes it could very well be that the Accord is cheaper overall, after considering all things. It does get a little better gas mileage for one thing. I've said before that the differences in net costs, considering initial purchase price and resale value, seem to be pretty small and should not likely be a significant factor for most. IOW, I don't think there is any reason to fear that the resale value is going to kill you if you do not buy an Accord or Camry...you will likely save enough up front to offset anywhere from a little more to a little less than the resale value difference. (In the case of the Mazda6 I lean toward believng you will save a little more  )I would feel the same way about a few cents per mile difference in operating costs. That it is not a significant enough difference to concern me. If someone else is concerned about this I would suggest adjusting the edmunds figures to fit their actual circumstances and see what the difference is then.BTW, I think the Accord SE is more comparable to the Mazda6 SVE...doesn't matter in this case as the cost per mile is the same as the LX.

This brings up an interesting observation I've made over the past few months - - For every person such as ourselves who know that MSRP isn't what you should be paying (99% of the time), there are many others that will walk away paying MSRP on a car, or more, not even having a clue that they could have paid thousands less. I know this isn't ground-breaking news, but it really amazes me how few people know that so much money can be saved by even the smallest amount of bargaining.

Absolutely, one should adjust for their own circumstances.In my case, because of my local dealers (only one Honda dealer and one Mazda dealer in town), the Accord ended up being the cheaper car to purchase. Of course, experiences will vary, as in other cities the Honda dealer might be snobby and the Mazda dealer might be easy to deal with, or there may be more than one dealer per make. We have two Ford and two Chevy dealers in town, but I wasn't as interested.I am less than impressed with our local Mazda dealer. There's another one about 30 miles away, but I'd rather buy local, and the Accord proved to be a worthy alternative, to me. "

Resale value is highly dependent on what kind of shape the car is in. When I was about to sell my 12 year old Accord I decided to go on Kbb.com and print out a for sale sign with the equipment list and all the details on the car. When I punched in the information, and got the suggested price, I started making my own simple sign that said ""For Sale"". IMO, KBB does not allow enough variation for the condition of the car. The difference in price between ""MINT"" condition, and TOTALLY CRAPPED OUT was not big enough. They seem to care more about mileage, than they do about the actual condition of the car. I easily got $1200 more than KBB said it was worth. "

true or not, a very very difficult thing to fathom on a purchase of this magnitude. Maybe I am assumming too much intelligence for the average American carbuyer?  I don't think it's a matter of intelligence, or lack there of. For Most people, buying a car is big deal, almost a special occasion. Unlike the car nuts here, I don't think its something the average person does more than once every 5-10 years. So, they go into the dealership with their mind already made up as to what they want, with the intention of driving it off the lot. Then the salesman steps in and starts throwing numbers and documents at them faster than they can possibly understand them. They totally loose track of what their paying for, and how much its costing them. then, they're off to the finance officer. He (in the same quick, incomprehensible fassion) starts throwing more numbers and papers arround, gives the buyer a monthly payment amount that they know the buyer will find too high. they then play with the loan term, or interest rate (maintaing the same prive for the vehicle and options) and come up with a $50 lower monthly payment. the owner quickly signs the papers thinking he just got a great deal, and doesn't realize he was realy screwed till a week or so later after spending 2 hours or so reading the 30 pages of documents he brought home with him.

When you buy a used vehicle, you never know what someone really paid for the car. The price is the price. The car is a value based object, if it is worth the price, with the miles, in the condition it is in, with the options it came with, if the dealer gave the car away for $1 it will not effect the resale price. The individual buyer might try to second guess the seller, but in the end the price is the price. Haggling is always a good strategy for the buyer. Buy low and sell high is a good strategy for the seller. "

I'm not anybody special... I don't know the dealer, salesman, or work for a company that offers special deals for buying mazda's. So, yeah, I geuss any average Joe could get a similar deal as I did. In fact I've seen advertisements in our local newspaper that were offering to sell mazda6's for less than I bought mine. But what buyers actually get talked into paying vs what dealers advertise is completely different. I think since many buyers are intimidated by the whole car buying process/ experience, many people act irrationally or impatiently and end up paying more than they need to. I knew what the situation was in terms of ad prices and the amount of inventory the dealers had so I leveraged this information to secure my pricing making clear to the dealers I negotiated with that I was in no particular hurry nor was I dead set in getting their car or even their brand. This midsize segment has many good cars and the vast majority of them have proven to be very reliable according to CR and JD Powers so having an open mind allowed me to be comfortable with choices that would let me maximize value and bang for my buck(s).

Points well taken, also part of it is that far too many buyers make these decisions based on payment size - something along the lines of walking into a dealer, with that car on their mind, as you say - and after some sticker shock will skip any preliminaries and directly ask the salesman (or this may be his first question) something like 'what can I get for $500.00/month?'. The answer to that question is, of course, almost anything, if you have reasonable credit and let the dealer work its 'magic'. A really big mistake IMO as the real price of anything is what it costs in cash. Giving the dealer the opportunity to 'play' with any multitude of 'financing' arrangements or (even worse) lease plans is nothing more than asking to get screwed. If I run into a salesman at a dealer that does ask me how much I want to pay a month initially, I will simply walk out! Thereafter the buyer's remorse you mention, simply because that buyer has no idea what he really paid for his car, only that he got his 500 buck payment, and a few years later is hit with some sort of refinance (or lease 'buyout') balloon or is paying some outrageous interest rate over a too long term on too high a price etc. etc. Again a hard concept for someone like me to understand - negotiate a cash deal (no trades or 'special' financing), that being the true cost of the car, and then go from there if you must.

I've heard that from other people as well about the Saab 9-3. I'd like to see how they are to drive since most people seem to say it is a performance oriented sedan. So, I wonder how much they sell for? I remember either summer of last year or the year before when GM was having their fire sale, the Saab's were being discounted heavily and I almost got the 9-2x aero (the turbo one) but by the time I got serious, they were sold out in my area. What do you think of the suspension and tranny on the 9-3? regardless, thanks for the insight... "

I don't remember the numbers right now, anyone can check them, but the price shown on TCO and TMV were different. Other variable costs in TCO were auite questionable also.The TCO purcahase price includes taxes and fees and ""typical"" options. But besides that, there is a difference in the TMV used in the TCO and the TMV you get when you go through the edmunds pricing function. For example the Accord SE TMV is about $600 lower in the TCO, while the Mazda6 SVE is about $100 higher in the TCO. "

that assumes that they would want a Mazda6 in the first place... but for those who want a fun to drive car that has an expressive personality and is priced very competitively, it may be worth considering.Yeah, I did not buy one because it was cheaper, that was just gravy  . Just out of my own curiosity I did my own TCO, assuming I paid invoice price minus rebate (not even considering the much greater discount that I actually got). I used edmunds numbers for repair and maintenance costs. I adjusted fuel costs to reflect the amount I drive. I used edmunds figures for expected value after 5 years. I assumed no significant difference in insurance cost, because I know in my case there would not be a significant difference. As I am a cash buyer, I estimated what I would earn (after tax) on the amount saved by purchasing a 6. For me this adjusted TCO came up with the Mazda6 being cheaper than the Accord by about 3 cents per mile. This shows how much things can vary when you look at your own individual circumstances, since the generic figues had the Accord at 3 cents per mile less than the Mazda6.Now, since 3 cents per mile one way or the other amounts to about $20 per month for me, this would not be enough of a difference to push me one way or the other anyway.

Those TCO figures can be so far from reality. For our '07 Sonata SE purchased in February: TCO says purchase price (before DMV fees, etc) is $20,855, we paid $16651. TCO says 1st year financing (with 10%) down = $1343, our 13.7% down shows our HMFC financing at $851 (the extra $700 down is NOT saving us $500 interest in the first year). The insurance, with 300K liability & UM, 5,000 medical, and $200 deductible comprehensive & $500 collision deductible is $400 less than TCO projects. TCO says the expected resale of this car after one year will be $15,195. If this is accurate, the 1st year deprecication would be $1,456, not the $6272 shown in TCO.Take the TCO with a grain of salt. As jeffyscott said, your actual purchase price will greatly affect your TCO. "

We sold it with just over 40k miles on the odo and I can find the second owner if you want to reimburse him for his repair costs too. Seriously though, my answer is no. I tried to like Honda's vehicles but just can't. I found that I just can't become passionate about a vehicle that has no passion to me. I'm very passionate about my Mustang but it is an American icon so not many people wouldn't be. I was passionate about my Mazda6 too because it was, simply put, an amazing car. Our Explorer? Well, I'm not so passionate about it because it is very much like a Honda in that it is an appliance which is how I see them. Also, that Civic was the highest mileage vehicle we've ever owned.

I was bored and decided to play with the EPA's new mileage estimates. I compared a 2008 FWD Taurus with a 2007 Accord V6 ATX and a 2007 Camry V6 ATX. Engines are 3.5L V6, 3.0L V6, and 3.5L V6 respectively. Trannies are 6sp, 5sp, and 6sp respectively. The Taurus and Camry have nearly equal HP while the Accord is short about 20 horses. EPA estimates for the three are 18/28, 18/26, and 19/28 respectively. The Taurus is the heaviest and the Accord is the lightest IIRC. For reference I threw in an Acura TL 3.5L V6 5sp ATX to see how the Honda 3.5L favored because it is supposedly similar to the new V6 for the Accord as we've talked about. It has roughly 20 more horses than the Taurus and Camry in terms of power and its weight falls somewhere in between the two. EPA estimates are 17/26. So I'm guessing we're not to expect great things fromt he Accord V6 when it comes to gas mileage? Cylinder deactivation should help a little I'm sure. But from what I understand based on other mfrs who have implemented it, including Honda in the Odyssey, it's only useful on long straight highways where you can just cruise along. I don't live anywhere near those types of roads so I surely wouldn't pay extra for that technology. "

We do after all have those 4 bangers for those willing to trade that extra performance for a mpg or two or three, don't we?Chrysler (and GM) both claim a 10% increase in overall FE with the 'variable displacement' systems they put on their gas hog V8s and I have observed the same thing you talk about, the inability of the cars to even hold anything close to current highway speeds on 4 cylinders. Would imagine it would be even less effective trying to get a 3400 lb. sedan to do the same given the lesser displacements (and torque) of the V6s. Think the real answers are right in front of us, OHC engines with intelligent control systems that maximize engine efficiency in almost all conditions and I wouldn't bet that Honda won't be able to take it to a next level above what Toyota has already done.

I can think of a few reasons. The MKZ still uses the Aisin 6 speed tranny instead of the new 6F joint venture tranny that the Taurus, Edge and MKX use. The 6F is supposed to be more fuel efficient. Not sure if the MKZ gets the 6F for 08 - I hope so. I also think they've had longer to tune the 3.5L in the Taurus for fuel economy now that Bill Ford is no longer in charge and emphasizing emissions over FE. If that's the case I would expect the 08 MKZ to have improved FE. "

I've spent about $1,000 in the last five years on three repairs. Not perfect, but not bad at all in my eyes.We got burned once in 1994, and in an act of stupidity, bought another one in 1996. BOTH proved to be garage-queens, with one vehicle needing a suspension rebuild, and both having transmission issues keeping them in the shop for not multiple days, but instead weeks.And, the lucky for us, the cars were so new, they never got out of their warranty (the '94 LeBaron Convertible had less than 20k miles and was traded 8 months after purchase on a 95 Civic. The '96 Sebring was sold at 35k miles because my folks knew they couldn't afford the car once in ran out of warranty - they came back to Honda the second and final time).

Also, I don't know they said it was MORE reliable, just that it was very reliable it's first year. They specifically said the Fusion was MORE reliable than both Camrys and the Accord V6, and just as reliable as the Accord I4.You obviously haven't experienced a new Ford lately because you have no idea what you're talking about and no facts to back it up.

That is ONE model for ONE year. Some consistency and long term quality please! Thank you. Also, I don't know they said it was MORE reliable, just that it was very reliable it's first year. I have a feeling the engineer's at Ford have figured out how to make something extremely reliable for the 3 years it is under warranty, and then BOOM, the makeup washes off and you have a junker on your hands. C'mon andres, you've got to give credit where credit is due. Ford Fusion's reliability rating was higher than that of Camry or Accord. That's published fact. Will it continue? Who knows. Will Honda's continue to be high with the '08 model year, or will it have issues like the 2003s (V6 tranny, Stereo Display come to mind)...? Who knows. The point is Ford came out with a brand new car and had virtually no teething problems. Honda and Toyota can't say the same for their latest ""new-for 20XX"" midsize models.Do I drive a Fusion? Nope. I really disliked the interior and fuel economy vs. horsepower tradeoff. I'm a Honda guy. I drive two different Accords and love them both.The writing is on the wall and can't be ignored (although some are proving that statement wrong), and it says that Ford has built a reliable product in the Fusion.

Or again, the flood gates aren't opening because of many things:One of which is a one year report card does not a reliable car make! I agree, the Fusion is impressive for a domestic, very impressive in it's first year. However, even my domestic lemon was actually more sweet than sour in it's first year. I believe its year 3 through 4 that are most telling in a vehicle; more than any other year. The Fusion however, shows strong signs of doing well, only time will tell however. You canNOT equate one good year with decades of Accord and Camry ""legendary"" reliability.Also, the interior that isn't in the same ballpark and the lower horsepower and gas mileage don't help matters. Some people might be willing to take the plunge after one ""turnaround year,"" but I'm not one of them with Ford's weak warranty; I'd rather get a GM! :P  "

Zainy demands ????I think its perfectly legitimate to make your demands, requirements, and requests known, and if the manufacturer denies them, then the manufacturer has failed to consider potentially good customers and it is not the customer who has not legitimately ""considered"" that manufacturer's products. I demand Chrysler deduct the purchase price of my lemon bought in 1994 (95 model) from any future Chrysler purchase. I think this is more than reasonable and fair, since I'm not charging interest, tow trucks, nor repair costs; just the purchase price. If the answer is no, then there will be no future purchase for them from me. It's quite simple really.Now all Ford or GM have to do is beef up the warranty and offer a payment plan when I have to use that warranty too much and too often.If they are so great now, why can't they do this?

I never spent a single dime on repairs outside of regular maintenance. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. I guess now you'll say that they start falling apart in year 7. I will agree that the current Fusion interior is not as nice as the Camcords, especially the center stack but that is being addressed for the 09 model. And Fuel Economy is way behind the competition. We'll see if that gets addressed for 09. "

Times change, as do fortunes. The Taurus was the best-selling car in the U.S. for nearly a decade but Ford squandered away its legacy and the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord climbed to the top of the mid-size heap where they comfortably remain.My wife and I decided on a Ford Fusion last December because of its style and handling; its creature features; its high ratings in Consumer Reports, J.D. Power and Associates and other respected publications.We also had enjoyed relatively good performance from two other Ford products, a 1997 Thunderbird with 85,000 miles on the clock and a 2000 Focus station wagon with 92,000 miles on the odometer.We also have a super Ford, Lincoln, Mercury dealer in town and got a fair -- but not sensational -- deal on a 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion.Except for poor in-city gas mileage -- a constant 14.8 mpg -- the Fusion has been perfect for seven months and 3,700 miles. The longest journey begins with a single step.Despite all that, the legions of passionate Honda owners on this forum make me wonder if we made a mistake. I don't think so at this juncture but the thought has entered my mind.I would never buy a Toyota because of the oil sludge debacle, a much worse scenario than the Ford Explorer's Firestone tires fiasco. Honda, on the other hand, has not been smitten by any major malfunctions and I know for certain that a 2007 Accord is going to be worth significantly more than our 2007 Fusion in three years.As good as the Fusion might be, I just don't see Ford, GM, Chrysler, Subaru, Nissan or anyone else dethroning Camry and Accord. It just ain't gonna happen. Camry and Honda owners are just too loyal (except for the sludge owners maybe). "

:P who's experience was good enough that not only would I get another Honda, but I'd recommend them instantly.However, due to the small amount of issues with my '03 Accord, I was unhappy with some of the service dept. employees and having to deal with them with my US built Accord. I was dissatisfied at having to visit the dealer more than zero times, let alone the half dozen or so times I had to go; mainly due to window moldings that they never had parts for, and then the big one being the tranny recall fix then failure soon thereafter.Honda dealt with me superbly and honored the vehicle by paying for everything, even after warranty. They even paid for the rental car with the embarrassing tranny debacle. Even with all that.... I currently most recently purchased a 2006 Audi A3 DSG Sport 2.0!  FANTASTIC CAR! Did I switch brands because Honda's lack of bulletproof (US Built cars) turned me off? Or did I simply switch because Honda refuses to currently make a hatchback/sportback type car thats bigger than a Mini?Probably a little of both, and the fact I wanted something new and the redesign wasn't ready yet. Now some say that Audi is the German Subaru, or is it Subaru is the Japanese Audi :P .Next time I go car shopping I'll include many considerations; especially Subaru with their stellar reliability; although in 20K miles the A3 has been mechanically and electrically flawless.When I chose the A3 I considered the Altima, A4, Camry, RAV4, 3 Series, Mazda 3, Mazda 6, Accord, Civic SI, GTI, GLI, TSX, TL (sort of; a bit out of my price range). I actually test drove the RAV4, Mazda3. I looked in and touched and studied in person the 3 Series, GTI, TSX, and TL. (Test drove 3 year old 325 BMW too if that counts; not impressed with the 2.5 gutless inline 6). "

With reading that you had to take your bullet proof Honda back to the dealer a half dozen or so times within 3 model years, I can't understand the blinders you are wearing.

I have taken it to the dealer for oil changes but no repair of anything has needed to be addressed by anyone.) Did you know that the 3 Series you considered does not have an oil dipstick?

Hey another mazda6 driver! Welcome, it's always good to have another person w/ great taste on this board! pros of the Mazda6- it's dual nature: can be quiet and composed but can also become extroverted and engaging when you want. the 6 can be extremely practical (especially in the hatch and wagon versions) while also being very indulgent. - thoughtful and unique engineering: things like having the volume of the stereo adjust itself automatically as the car goes faster or slower and the levers in the trunk that with a simple pull, the 60/40 seats spring forward when you need to transport some bigger items. cons:lots of brakedust requires frequent cleaning of the wheels to keep them looking decent armrests on the doors are too hardturning radius is a bit largeno mp3/ auxilary input (easily fixed by aftermarket though)gauges and center console display needs a redesign - they don't look bad, but for a car with lots of charisma everwhere else, this area needs some attention.

Glad you enjoyed my humor. My experience with Honda. First one ( a 79 Accord) when about 112K, and, engine blew. Second one, bought for son, was an 83 Accord with a little over 100K on it. The 5 speed manual destroyed itself shortly after we purchased it, and, had to be replaced. The car made it to about 160K, and, the oil pump drive failed, frying the engine. The next, for other son, was a early 90's civic, bought used. It made it to about 109K, when the engine's valvetrain destroyed itself. Engine was replaced, and, the car made it to about 150K and was sold. I bought a new 91 Accord that, under warranty, lost its AC, both healight assemblies, had brake problems, and absolutely couldn't be aligned so it wouldn't eat tires in less than a few thousand miles. Car was traded in at 20K miles. Last Honda was a late 90's used Civic, bought for Daughter to take to college and work. Had about 40K on it when we bought it. During the 2 years she drove it, the window mechanisms failed, one side mirror fell off, the exhaust manifold/convertor assembly broke ($1000 fix), and the engine developed a huge thirst for oil. At 86K, it needed an engine overhaul, and, I sold it. Do I think Chryslers are that great - not hardly. I buy them for business use because they're cheap, and, I dump them around 95K miles.

...the Accord's ""value"" trim level seems to be the LX-P this time around if you don't seek a sunroof. It appears that the very first spy shots of the Accord sedan were indeed a Silver LX-P as many speculated here and on Vtec.netI'm disappointed in a lack of features though seeing as the Accord is Honda's flagship sedan. The Camry and even the Altima have some features that this ""flagship"" is missing yet the CamTima aren't flagships.For example, I would have liked bluetooth at least standard on EX-L models but it appears you have to get the Navigation system to get it. Push button start would have been neat as well, to some it's a gimmick but i really like it. I drive a truck now (lol..from college student to car salesman to truck driver) and my truck as push button start...it's kinda neat. What about a rearview Camera with Nav. system? Steering wheel climate controls (Camry and Fusion have those on top level trims) reclining rear seats?Power adjustable pedals? Rear audio controls?It appears that equipment levels really aren't changing and that the LX-P is really nothing more than an SE with a power driver's seat. Wouldn't Honda's whole claim of being the ""most luxurious"" sedan in the class be false, seeing as both the Camry and Altima at current levels seem to offer more than the Accord will? The list is just preliminary, but I would think if some stand out features were coming they'd be mentioned. For example, rain-sensing wipers..they don't appear to be there. "

A few thoughts - looks pretty much like what people would expect, based on previous Accord generations.A few notes/questions:1) No LX V6? That's a bummer; I think there's definitely room in this lineup for, for example, an LX-P V6 to slot in below the EX V6.2) Why can't we have dual zone auto climate control without having to take leather? I frekin hate leather, especially if the cloth interior is done well. Along the same lines, I wish NAV was available on non leather models as well.3) Keyless start and music hard-drive, anyone?

...thank insiders on Vtec.net. I'm just a fast messenger.I agree an LX-PV6 should be available seeing as the ole ""SEV6"" was a HOT seller for Honda, or so it seemed, yet they couldn't move an LXV6 before 2006 when it had the same features as the SE sans the alloy wheels. I also agree on some of your other points. Honda is far far to conservative with features it seems. What about some Xenon headlights for the EXLV6? And maybe more color combinations? White can't be had with Gray or black interiors...  I wonder what the ""SE"" models will be like at the end of this new generation's cycle in about 5 years?But even if it lacks some features...I still find it as attractive as the current Altima. And that's a LOT coming from someone who didn't care for the current generation. I still say the Camry will have a slight lead in the features department if this preliminary list is all the Accord will get. "

Seems a bit much when first looking at them, but those trim levels are easier to deal with then say 3 trims with multiple avaiable options (especially true for the Altima, Camry and Fusion)Fusion: Has FiveSSE/SEV6SEL/SELV6 But the options make things hecticCamry: Has 8!!!!CELE/LEV6SE/SEV6XLE/XLEV6HybridThings get real crazy with the Camry...especially if you won't certain options that appear on paper but are far from reality.Altima: Has six2.52.5S2.5S with SL pkg.3.5SE3.5SLHybridFrom experience.

In my opinion, that is one of the reasons why Accords have high resale value. It is easy to price a certain trim level as there are no options. It is OK to have options bundles like the Altima does, they don't add too much confusion. However, when your options list is a mile long, the used vehicle becomes harder to value, and the price of many of those options when the vehicle was purchased new may not get reflected in the book value.

I agree, I think the Mazda6 is a great-looking car even though the design is five years old. It would be my top choice in this field were it not for questions about safety (no IIHS side impact tests run with the side airbags) and mediocre fuel economy.

It's crazy in that in the SE, a lot of ""options"" that are available in the brochure will never be found on the lots. Maybe I should have been more specific seeing as it's my region and the distribution center and not just Toyota as a Company. Yet even with the options that are available on the Camry, it's not as easy to find say a Camry LE with Alloys, Sunroof and JBL verses say an Accord EX.It gets that much more complicated with the SE model where certain packages are only available with the automatic transmission and even then in certain regions Toyota (the Company) doesn't allow certain model configurations. That's CRAZY in that the brochure says you can get them, but in reality you can't. Example try finding say a Camry XLEI4 with just the VSC option without leather.So while the list may be shorter, many of the options aren't available to every and those that are get combined most of the time and aren't really a la carte.Honda makes is simpler by just making trim levels optionless.CE for example is pretty easy to equipt.LE models get a bit more difficult in the SE region..and XLE models come either no option XLE or loaded "

My wife's finalists were the Optima and the Fusion/Milan. I do agree with you that the four cylinder in the Optima seemed quite a bit more sophisticated, funny because we found the same basic engine in the Sebring to be a lot rougher. The other kicker was interior quality, she got the LX with appearance group and add-on leather for $16,100. The best thing about the appearance group is the electroluminescent lighting, some of the other features are strangely crippled-- only car I've ever seen without a MPG indicator on its DIC-- hopefully they'll correct that for 08. Our enthusiasm for the Optima would have applied only to the four, the six doesn't give you much more in power plus you have a timing belt to fool with. With the optional 17 inch Michelins, the Optima is close in handling to the Fusion/Milan. The better NVH and nicer interior plus lower price trump any advantage in that department. "

Honda does have reliability on lock, I have heard the accord referred to as "" bulletproof"". But when something does go south, it costs a fortune to fix.

The I4 engines in the Sebring and Optima/Sonata really aren't the same.

The differences you're referring to are only important to a small handful of enthusiasts, most of whom wouldn't buy a Fusion anywaySee, we finally agree on something. The only problem I have with this statement, is WHY? Why can't somebody who buys a Fusion also be part of your 'handful of enthusiasts'? Would suggest to you, that even the 6, hampered by similiar drivetrain limitations, caters almost specifically to the enthusiast. Almost all the cars in this group have something to 'hang its hat on'. Examples: Honda a silky smooth 4 and V6, gas mileage, resale values, probable reliablility, along with a ride that is a good compromise between sporting and soft, the Camry pretty much the same except with a generally 'softer' ride, the Sonata, price and a really decent V6 for cheaper than most other 4s, the Altima a legendary V6, spunky 4, high resales and the CVT, the 6, handling and price etc. At which point we come to the Fusion and I guess all we can talk about is how cheap (or subjectively pretty) they are and the gas consumption qualities of silly AWD?And yes the Fusion should remain less of a car, unless Ford can figure out a way to get some improved version of the 3.5 in it. By the time Ford gets around to its rumored 240hp 3.0, it will likely still be at least 40-50hp (and a few mpgs) short of what the big boys are doing by then. "

After 25 years of owning nothing but Accords (78, 86, 98) I bought an Aura XR last month and I love it. I tested Camry, Accord, Mazda 6, Fusion, and Aura. The Aura was head and shoulders above all the other choices. It was tough to disabuse myself of my anti-American car bias, but it wasn't a tough decision once I compared all the cars. I love the power, comfort, ride, quiet interior, styling (interior and exterior) and the value. Terrific buying experience and $2250 in incentives. If you had told me that I would buy a Saturn a week before I did, I would have laughed. I set out to buy a Camry or another Accord, but forced myself to look at more than those cars and I'm glad I did. Camry and Accord are great cars. No brainer purchases. I found the Aura to be a better car and a better value. Time will tell if that was a good decision.

What I meant was the number of enthusiasts who care whether the V6 has 221 hp or 260 and who would consider buying a Fusion is relatively small and wouldn't make a big difference in overall sales. What the Fusion needs is a nicer interior and better fuel mileage and more features. The Camry doesn't sell 400k units a year to enthusiasts.In addition to the rumored 240 hp 3.0 there is a twin turbo 2.5L putting out 260 hp but hopefully getting better fuel mileage than comparable V6s. Of course if that happens you'll just find some other excuse to not like the Fusion. "

you'll just find some other excuse to not like the Fusionwell that excuse might just be the styling, but that is, of course, subjective.

If Ford chooses to use Mazda's artificially aspirated 4 banger that obviously solves the HP deficiencies likely sacrificing some of that reliability that Ford is actually doing pretty well at right now. The 'older' Mazda6 is reporting reliabilities several notches below the Fusion - don't know if this is because of the turbo model, the fact that the 6 is made here, or a forecast of things to come for the Fusion. And you are right, there aren't many 'enthusiasts' that consider the Camry (except possibly the SE), that softer 'Americanized' ride in the LE/XLE one of the reasons why the Camry is so absurdly successful although the SE V6 is something the enthusiast could drive with a smile on his face.

After a driving it a little over 1K miles this past 2 weeks I believe I will update my observations and since the transmission repair on our 95 Stratus should be finished today or tomorrow it will likely be my last.1. My initial observation of a noisy (induction noise) engine remains. we have become ""used"" to it but it there...constantly.2. The initial dislike of a high trunk and rear package shelf has become more intense. I cannot see adequately out the back when reversing into a parking stall and any car or obstacle behind is hard to see/judge the distance to.3. The ride and handling remains one of my favorite parts of this vehicle. The ride is taunt (on the firm but not harsh side) and handling is good with the Continental tires supplied. I did not push it beyond high normal type cornering however.4. The interior space is fairly large and the seats (the driver seat anyhow)is comfortable or was for me during a 300 mile drive on Saturday.5. The amount of standard features are sparse as compared to both a lower end 2006.5 Kia Optima and a 2006 Hyundai Sonata I recently rented.6. Engine performance is OK (adequate) and again comparing it to the Kia and Sonata (both 4 cylinders) feels slower with both Korean cars fairly jumping off the line and reving freely to the upper RPM ranges. Maybe it is the engine noise that makes the engine feel more strained than it is? 7. Fuel economy: I used this car as work car driving it back and forth to work which is a 12 mile one way drive for me. I have two traffic lights..#1 (almost always red coming from a secondary road onto US Rt. 30) and another on the military facility where I work. I have a total of two stop signs with usually NO or minimum wait for any amount of time at either. All roads traveled are 2 lane rural with the exception of a short (2 mile stretch of Rt 30). Speeds probably average 45-50 mph. All in all a much more free of ""hassles"" commute than most. So in addition to that we used it to putter around our small city (town really) after work. Typical stop and go with little or no gridlock...mostly ""no"". Drive to Wal Mart..drive to Circuit City..drive to a local resturant and eat supper kind of thing. we probably drove it a total of 35 to 40 mile a day including my 24 mile round trip to work. After a week and a bit over 1/2 of gas of that type of use I added 9.573 gallons and traveled 242.6 miles yielding 25.35 mpg.This past Saturday we drove it on a 300 mile road trip. I used the Pa Turnpike...I-81 and some ""secondary"" or rural 4 lane limited access highways. I kept the speed on the first part of the trip ( mostly because I had my 85 year old mother in the car)to less than 70 mph..about 68. Once we dropped her off at relatives the return trip was a bit faster @ 72-73 mph. All in all I was ""good"" with no abrupt increases of speed (A.K.A. road rage)no mountains this time and no luggage on the return. There were 3 of us on the first part and 2 on the return trip. I think that unless you slowed to 60 or 65 the car couldn't be expected to get better mileage...in other words it was optimal for fuel economy. I refilled it with between 1/4 and 1/2 tank remaining used 10.003 gallons and drove 306.4 miles for an average of 30.64 mpgSummary: I probably wouldn't buy one because of the above perceived (by me) faults. Handling and ride was good. Standard features were slim. Fuel economy was good/average for the size/engine. I guess here is where the Accord folks will say low because they get 34..whatever. It had no squeaks or rattles and quality was good from what I could see (paint seems good and fit and finish also good). Interior plastics were of the rubbery type in many places and I liked that. Ergonomics were less than good with the headlight switch low and to the far left on the dash and the radio was a ""park first to adjust"" type. Even after two weeks I still didn't trust myself to adjust it while driving and always asked my wife to find a station etc. Steering wheel audio controls appreciated. I appreciated having a car these two weeks but in the end it was just that...a car.P.S. almost forgot safety (and that is important to me). If you are one who considers ABS, traction control, and ESC safety pluses this car doesn't have them...any of them. One CAN get ABS as an option on all models and traction control as an option on V-6 models but not ESC. Not available yet on any model. "

Nice review. Regarding the rear visibility - it took me about 6 weeks to get used to it. After that it's not a problem. But it was a little disconcerting at first. Lack of some features is understandable since it's a base S model. Lack of ESC and only average fuel economy are fair complaints. "

ESC safety pluses this car doesn't have them...any of them.there is a reason for this - lack of a sophisticated enough braking system in the first place. Shooting juice (brake fluid) to individual brakes (as ESC will do) requires not only a yaw sensor to make a determination of when your car needs 'help', the computer to make that decision for you (and administer the 'fix'), but also an extra circuit in the brake system itself - neither of which the Fusion has even available. Given that the government is forcing these systems on us anyway, expect that Ford will have to 'upgrade' their braking systems in the next model year or two. It is not that they can't do it, ESC is available on other models - it may be more a function of not having the money to do it for the Fusion right now. "

The rumor is they made a conscious marketing decision to go with AWD instead of ESC early on (when the competition wasn't yet offering ESC) and couldn't change it at the last minute. It should be fixed with the 09 refresh. "

Why do you have to question other people's subjective preferences for a specific vehicle just because you don't share that opinion?Because I wonder what makes the Aura ""head and shoulders above"" the competition in their eyes. That's what I already posted.I liked the Aura when I sat in it at the dealer but didn't get the same superior vibe. Their opinion is backed by zero reasons why its better.Let's hear why. "

They do charge and how $263. I caught on to the brakes by checking the customer observations on I think MSN autos. A huge percentage of Honda owners reported brake problems on the 03. They made it right though. "

Some people might be willing to take the plunge after one ""turnaround year,"" but I'm not one of them with Ford's weak warranty; I'd rather get a GM! The only difference between Ford's Fusion and GM's Malibu or Aura warranties is that GM will give you more miles to use in those 5 years on the Malibu and Aura.Since the average is 12k miles per year for any of these cars it's kind of useless and really only sounds good on paper when you really think about it. The number of people who can actually use those miles is pretty darn small. Ford also included '06 Fusions purchased after a certain date. It was a nice gesture by them and shows their confidence in current products. IIRC GM did not roll their warranty back for the Malibu, Aura or anything else. "

what did you like most about it? Or better yet, what ways did you find it superior to other cars you shopped for. what surprissed you the most?
First some background because I think it's important to know where an opinion is coming from. I'm not a car guy. I'm 52 years old. I spend a lot of time stuck in Southern CA traffic. I buy a car, keep it for years, and pay little attention to the industry until it's time to buy again. My last two purchases were new Accords, 1986 and 1998. I looked at no other cars.I went shopping with the following criteria in order of importance:Less than $25kQuiet ridesix cylinder engineexterior/interior stylevalue for the moneyI paid $22,845 plus tax/license for the Aura. For that I got a 252hp V6 engine, six speed auto transmission, 18 inch alloy wheels that look great, 4-wheel ABS disk brakes, stability control, front, side, and rear-side passenger airbags, a 200-something watt stereo with 8 speakers that sounds very nice, iPod integration with an aux input, OnStar, and a beautifully styled exterior and interior car. Just as important, I was able to get what I wanted without having to get other stuff I didn't want like XM radio, faux wood interior trim, leather seats and a sunroof. Aura has a five star safety rating.The Aura's ride was the quietest and most refined of all the cars I tested. It's not like a Buick, but it doesn't ride as hard/loudly as the Mazda or the Accord. It's a perfect combination (for me) of road feel and quiet comfortable ride. When I set out on this trek, I was sure I wanted a Camry because of its well deserved reputation for reliability and quiet ride, even though I never did warm to the new (or older) design. I will say though, that the current exterior design is better looking than the previous generation.I prefer the Aura's exterior styling to the Camry's styling and I was immediately turned off by Camry's center dashboard. It looked cheap (especially that plastic door that hides the Aux port for the iPod) and I didn't like the style/coloring of the radio and climate control stuff. 100% subjective opinion. Others may disagree. Different strokes for different folks. Camry had a nice quiet ride, but I couldn't get past that ugly dash. A comparably equipped Camry would have cost thousands more than the Aura. The current generation Accord is at the end of its life which was one of the reasons why I never seriously considered it. When the 08 model comes out I may regret that decision, but I doubt it. The spy photos I've seen on the internet haven't caused buyer's remorse. Honda just doesn't build quiet rides in the Accord. The Mazda had the same problem: too hard/loud and it's style-challenged to my eye. But I loved the wagon's styling. That's a very cool looking car, but it's not a sedan.I liked the Fusion but it just lacks the panache that the Aura has. I really like the exterior design, but the interior left me uninterested and the model I drove didn't have an aux connector or the salesman couldn't find it. Having drooled at the Fusion's I've seen in traffic, this was second on my list of cars to test. They have an eye-catching design.What surprised me most about the Aura was how great a value it is. It's a great package. It does a lot of things well for a very good price. The other thing that surprised me was that I could be won over to an American car on its merits alone. The $2,250 in incentives played no part in my decision to buy. I would have gladly paid MSRP (no haggle pricing still in effect at Saturn). Before seeing/driving the Aura XR, I never dreamed I would buy it. I had to force myself to even consider it so great was my bias against American nameplates. Things have changed. GM is building some great cars now. Based on my experience, I'm convinced that there is a gap between the quality of these new models and buyers' perceptions which presents an opportunity to get a great car at a value price.GM is certainly aiming at the Japanese buyer with the Aura, but the car is more aligned with European imports. It is in fact, an Opel Vectra, a German car made in Kansas City. The Saab 9-3 shares the same platform as well. The interior design more closely resembles my friend's Audi than any of the Japanese imports I considered and it's ride is more like a Euro sports sedan. All the cars I tested are fine automobiles. You can't go wrong purchasing any of them. It's hard to make a bad decision in the mid-sized category any more because the cars are so good. The Aura met my objective and subjective requirements. It was a no-brainer.If you're considering a Japanese import with a six cylinder engine, I would encourage you to consider the Aura. It's an incredible value and a fine car. My wife drives a 2007 Nissan Maxima for work. She has always owned Japanese imports. She thinks the Aura is superior in every way to her Maxima with the exception of power which she thinks is a tie.Ultimately, deciding on a particular car is an emotional experience dependent on many factors which differ for all of us. The Aura and I just connected. Your mileage/criteria may vary. And that's OK. "

Great review - spot on! I ended up with the Accord SE, which is much like the Aura XR package. They gave me a better trade-in and about the same or better discount off sticker when compared to Saturn deal. I slightly prefer the cornering and ride of the Accord, though the Aura does handle well. As for power, the Aura is like a rocket. Accord is good too, but Aura is great and the 6 sp. transmission with the paddles works well. The Aura seems a little smaller inside though. Seems like my knee hit the center column easier - just tighter feel overall. Do NOT like emergency brakes on the floor. Do like the DOHC 3.6 engine - lovely engine indeed. Steering is good - still prefer the slightly heavier Accord steering. The door window sills could be a tad lower on the Aura. I bet the New Accord for 2008 will have the too tall door syndrome as well. Overall though, the Aura is a pleasing car. I also like the Cadillac CTS and would not pass on a Corvette if someone gave me one. Can't think off hand of other offering from GM at the moment which seem like winners in the car World, but perhaps another one will come to mind by tomorrow. The New Malibu will be a possible sucess and suck some sales from Aura. Currently the good, but not great XE Aura, I think takes away some luster from the New Saturn - New Aura image. But, as always, IMHO. The XE is NOT A BAD car, it is just something I think was not the thing to do, as it takes away from the more upscale image of Aura vs. the G6, vs. the New Malibu. The New Malibu, BTW will have the sexiest interior. :shades: Loren "

I, for one, am surprised that the Saturn/Opel Aura doesn't get more ink in this forum. Also impressed with all aspects of the car (the XR) and particularly the 3.6, although I felt the interior fit and finish and egronomics a smidge below some of the 'Japanese' competitors. Would be interested in your continuing observations on the car (FE?) as I look to replace a 4 year old Altima 3.5 I own. Like you perhaps, my biases definitely runs towards the 'Japanese' side of things if only because of the great service I get out of them and some of those great V6s available, but this particular GM car is one that just might lead me to break a long tradition. Saturn, BTW, will also be 'importing' another Opel design shortly to replace the Ion although FWIU it will be saddled with the 'Ecotec' 4 banger.What I find difficult to understand is that we have 3 large mfgrs based in this country, all of which are in supposed financial difficulties, and only one of them seemingly can produce a car truly competitive in this segment. More and better choices especially from a car built in this country by a US based mfgr. would be a good thing! Don't know if the Aura is quite strong enough to get me off the last 3 Altimas I've bought, but a serious contender. Enjoyed your 'evenhanded' review, don't be a stranger here  "

akirby - have said several times that I don't believe the Fusion is competitive simply because of what's under the hoods - something I also believe is easily confirmed by just reading the engine/FE specifications (and a test drive). Obviously an opinion nonetheless, that you Ford folks must take personally for some reason - you'll note that I purposely didn't mention the Fusion in this post because that is not what the post is about, it was about what appears to be a really good effort by a different 'Detroit' mfgr.. If it was Ford that had the 3.6 instead of the Saturn, I would be talking about it in the same sort of terms as the Aura, believe it or not. Go out and drive the XR, other than some untamed torque steer (kinda like my wife's Altima) you will find a wonderfully powerful car that also manages to be smooth and quiet - the way it should be.I think that it will be the 08 Malibu (because it should be a marginally cheaper and higher volume model) that will establish a 'Detroit' benchmark in this class, and it is better for all of us, the autoworkers, and this country in general that both it, the Aura and even the Fusion do well.

My point is the Fusion is very competitive from an overall standpoint. The fact that it doesn't meet your requirements doesn't make it uncompetitive.I could just as easily say the Accord, Camry, Aura and Sonata are not competitive because they don't offer AWD but that would be silly.Why can't we use phrases like ""I don't like"" or ""doesn't meet my needs"" instead of ""not competitive"" or ""not as good""?

As I could say the Aura is not competitive in this class because it comes only with a V6, and not a more fuel-efficient and lower-cost I4. But that would be silly. It's clearly competitive in the subclass of mid-sized V6 cars. And the Fusion/Milan are fully competitive in this class. Tops in class? Highly debatable. But competitive? Certainly. "

OK, let me ask you this, would you buy a Fusion for less than a $3,000 off the sticker? What do you consider a good buy price on the Fusion V6. Would it be a value at the same cost of a discounted Accord SE or an Aura XR at say around $22,500 ? Are you at all worried about Ford's future as a company?As for looks, yeap, the Fusion or even better the Milan look pretty sharp, with a bit of tall butt. Did a brief drive test and the steering feels pretty darn good, with good engine and transmission performance. Overall, it was an OK car. The interior is good, but there is better. I would not pass it up if someone gave me one. :shades: I pretty much looked at all the cars in this class. Most impressive, IMHO, was the Aura XR and the Accord SE, especially the V6. The Altima, with CVT wasn't my cup o' tea, and I really disliked the emergency brake location. Push button start is something different. The Sonata is OK, but when pushed, like on a rough road, the suspension seemed like it was bottoming or making sounds of such. Steering was good, but not great. Seemed like an 85% car compared to the best or best tested. If you weight things like handling the most, I liked the Honda, then Aura, and Fusion. The Altima seemed a bit more noisey, with good cornering, but too light a steering feel about it. Accord and Fusion have better feel. I know, opinions, as some will prefer heavier feel.Loren "

I should have qualified the first statement. The sum of all the cars design, looks, seats, drive train, abilities, resale, value, warranty, interior, exterior, safety equipment, standard features, you know from the hood prop to the gas cap = all inclusive, IMHO it is not the best of best.

I noticed that some feel that the Fusion isn't competitive. I have driven one and feel that it is a very nice driving vehicle and has a nice interior with a lot of front seat room for a midsize. However, where it falls short as many others have noted is the engine. Its all been said before but IMO that is what kills the car. In terms of MSRP a loaded V6 Fusion isn't that much off from the V6 Cam/Cord/Alt. So if Ford didn't offer rebates and deep disounts at the dealer the Fusion wouldn't be competitive at all because it would be the same price as the rest with less power, FE, safety features, and creature comforts.

Update:We went out again last evening. At this point, my wife is dead-set to get a manual, whether or not it's AWD. After test-driving a slushbox or two, she just can't give up the manual (which makes me VERY proud, BTW!)'07 Mercury Milan Premier (4-cylinder, 5-speed manual): Yes, it's rare to have a Premier model with the 4-cylinder and 5-speed, but they're out there. Same initial impressions as before, but the 4-cylinder is a little more coarse than both the DT3.0 and the 2.5 4-cyl from the Altima. The 5-speed is pretty smooth to operate, but the car should either have a 6th gear or the gearing revised, because it revs higher than the 2.5S 6-speed at highway velocities, and I'm sure it affects both the NVH and fuel economy. The loaded Premier for the same price as the mid-grade 2.5S (without leather) was enticing though...After discussion over dinner, and reviewing the online offers from a couple different Nissan dealers, we decided to get the 2.5S. Why? That's easy: 1. Great gas mileage (26 city, 35 hwy, which matches the current 2000 Neon 5-speed that she drives now)2. Very nice interior (IMO about five levels higher than the embarrasing interior that my mother has in her '03, with richer materials and excellent fit-and-finish)3. The 6-speed manual (which is smooth and easy to operate, isn't notchy, and feels better than my 5-speed in my Mazda6)4. Firm but nice ride, and excellent handling (better than everything else save my Mazda6, IMO)After comparing the local dealer offers, we ended up at the closest dealer to us, which is a small, family-run business that's been around for over 30 years selling Datsun/Nissan. My wife and I placed a deposit on an '07 Altima. It's the 2.5S, 6-speed manual, Majestic Blue with the Charcoal cloth interior, with the Convenience Plus package (leather wheel and shifter, power drivers seat, moonroof, 16"" alloy rims, etc.) and floor mats. Despite the fact that it has to come from Connecticut (I'm in upstate NY), it's EXACTLY what my wife wants (yes, both she and I both currently drive and love a three-pedal car).It'll be shipped by early next week, and ready for pick-up by the 28th.We are VERY happy both with the car itself and the purchase experience, and hope to have excellent luck with it in the future.

would you buy a Fusion for less than a $3,000 off the sticker?Price never entered into the equation. I don't shop on price - I buy whatever I like and try to get the best price on that. I'm too picky about styling and features. Before the Fusion debuted I had decided to get an Accord. But the Fusion had the looks and features I wanted and it had a unique Piano Black interior trim and unique Tungsten grey paint that I still think looks fantastic. Would I have bought it if it was the same price as the Accord? Sorry to disprove your theory but the answer is yes.If you think that people only buy Fusions and Milans because they are cheaper you're mistaken. People who want cheap would be buying Kias. "

In terms of MSRP a loaded V6 Fusion isn't that much off from the V6 Cam/Cord/Alt.True, but it is a good bit cheaper to buy than a loaded Camry or Accord V6 which would give us an apples to apples comparison then.  "

It's had a $500 rebate since day one even when supplies were short so I have to believe Ford simply built that into the pricing because some domestic buyers just won't buy without some type of rebate. a condition that the 'American' manufacturers have 'taught' the American carbuyer - if they are going to shop those brands, they EXPECT larger rebates (and other incentives) as you say - something that Buick, for example, specializes in - overpricing a car with those 'built-in' rebates. The Camcord shopper, OTH, is doing well to get close to invoice (except possibly on EOY model changes). And then we wonder why those 'Detroit' brands don't hold their resale values that well, so much so that even the steep discounts can't make them cheaper to own than those Camcords they 'compete' with. And part of the reason why Ford/GM/Chrysler are losing money faster than it can be printed? Wouldn't it be nice for those same mfgrs. if they made a car that was good enough and/or in demand (the two kinda go together) enough that MSRP and invoice meant something? "

Small rebates ($1K or less) don't really hurt, especially if they're consistent. What hurts is adding $2K-$3K in rebates later. That reduces the resale values across the board and that is what has happened in the past. It will take years to get the buying public off the rebate wagon. Interestingly Honda and Toyota are increasing rebates on some models (Odyssey and Tundra, not Camcords) and given the reliability records of the 06/07 models so far it sounds like the tables may be slowly turning.

Congratulations! Awesome choice with the 6-speed. I didn't even look at these when I bought my Accord in February, because I knew I'd want one!

I't doesn't bother me because NVH isn't an issue, and my old 626 V6 used to spin 4,000 at the same speed (7k redline).What RPM does the Nissan 2.5 6-speed turn in 6th? "

Between that, the 35 MPG rating for highway (compared to 31 for the Milan), and the extra cog, I'll assume that it's lower than the Milan.

and why I guy like me is just not going to want to buy one at this point, is long term reliability. When you've owned GM cars for a while, you start to learn that at first, everything seems great. At the time, my Intrigue was sort of the equivalent of what the Aura is today. It beat Camry in a CD comparo back in the day. It was Detroit's great hope. But what gradually drove people away was long term reliability. After a couple of years, things just starting going wrong. And wrong. And wrong. And so on. And now the same thing has started happening to our '04 Malibu Maxx. And the same thing happened to my wife's '00 Alero a few years ago.Is the '08 Aura a better car than those were? Well, generationally speaking, I don't know that you can say that. Its hardly groundbreaking considering its competition. But sure, its appealing. At this point, though, I want PROOF that it will hold up for a good 7-8 years. And obviously we won't get that proof for a while.So I'd really hesitate to buy it. "

I want PROOF that it will hold up for a good 7-8 years. And obviously we won't get that proof for a while.So I'd really hesitate to buy it.There's no way any mid-size car manufacturer can meet that standard, since the 2007 or 2008 or 2009 model is going to be considerably different than a 2000, 2001 or 2002 model.Assuming the Honda Accord to be the best 2000, there is no guarantee that the much-altered 2007 will equal its reliability, endurance, etc. because so many changes will have been made in the interim.Cars are like stocks: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Buying any new mid-size is a crap shoot. Some makes and models are going to be better than others, no matter what.The 2007 Aura might be the best mid-size sedan GM has ever built and it may be trouble-free into 2014 but that doesn't necessarily mean that the 2014 model will fare as well.

I don't agree, and neither does Consumer Reports (I know! I uttered the dreaded CR!)If a manufactuer--say, Honda--consistenly builds reliable cars, every year, than there is a much, much greater chance--both statistically and rhetorically--that they will continue to do so. CR is generally willing to give reliability recommendations on new models when the previous model performed very well for the life of the car for that reason, and past performance is a very reliable indicator of (no pun intended) reliability.And really, this goes beyond mid-size cars. General Motors, for instance, has consistent long term reliability issues across all models--many of them are shared-component problems (ie, brakes). That could well change, but it will be a while before we know. It doesn't take 7-8 years (though I did mention that), I think we'll probably have a good idea in 3-4 or so. But what I speak of is an overall problem. According to many CSR's at GM dealers I've spoken with (and, unfortunately, I've gotten to know them very well), the problems we've experienced with our Malibu also show up on G6, Trailblazer, the minivans, etc. They're more systematic than anything else.The other issue which I didn't bring up is how a manufacturer treats these issues when they do come up. GM's got a ways to do here, also. "

One thing with Honda is they excel at everything they build. Be it cars, motorcycles, marine engines, lawn equipment, jet skis, etc.Several of Honda's outboard marine engines use basically what is in their cars. THe civic 4cyl is used in Honda's medium HP outboards and the Odyssey 3.5L v6 is the basis for the 225hp Honda outboard. If an engine can hold up to marine use and can pretty much withstand anything. Honda is always one of the tops in reliability in the marine category too. Amazingly, a HOnda 225hp outboard engine costs more than a whole civic. "

Didn't something similiar happen with the Saturn L-series? Winning awards, receiving praise in road tests, etc... until the problems started surfacing. I think it took a couple of years before the major ones came out.Of course, as mentioned above, this is no gaurantee of how the Aura or any other GM built today will fare into the future. But past performance is really all we have to go by as far as estimating long-term reliability. How well can we estimate that? Probably not too well.An interesting note: during my short stint as a car salesman, I sold a Mustang GT automatic to a middle-aged man who used to calibrate the machines used to build engines at Ford. He was very specific on getting the 4.6L V8 instead of any other Ford engine for ""durability purposes."" He had no interest in the performance potential, and his wife was going to be the main driver. On the test drive, she didn't even rev it past 2,500 RPM. He stated, and I can't remember his source, that when domestic companies engineered car parts, they set certain ranges for the various parameters the engineers had to work with: what materials may be used, how much the finished part would cost to make, and how long it would last.The funny thing was, he told me, that if the part was designed outside of the ranges either way... too expensive OR too cheap, wears out too fast in testing OR lasts too long... it was rejected. They didn't want their cars to last too long or their parts sell too cheap.Is this true? I certainly don't know, and I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever. But after my experience with my 2004 Ford, it certainly wouldn't surprise me. "

CR, for whatever fault or differences we all might have with their particular priorities, is the only organization I know of that does things like reliability studies/comparison tests/satisfaction surveys and is not beholden to anybody for whatever results they come up with. As such it should be taken seriously by those consumers valuing an 'intelligent' purchase decision. I have noticed that CR does have a tendency to 'recommend' a car earlier than they might otherwise if it happens to be from a mfgr. that has a superior track record as opposed to one that doesn't. I have no problem with this, but we probably also need to understand that sooner or later all things change and that as all cars are improving from a reliability standpoint,that this (reliability) may eventually become a non-factor especially for those of us that usually buy our cars new. It wasn't all that long ago that a car was deemed junk at 50 or 60k (and generally was), nowadays that's barely broken in... "

It's not all that hard to understand at all. Having to take a car back to the dealer for warranty service a half dozen or so times is easily accomplished when your dealing with a service department that leaves a little to be desired. Also, they never stock any parts, even for the Accord.So thats 2 visits for one thing, and if that one thing goes wrong twice, that's 4 visits already!!! You can reach 6 to 8 visits easy. The reason I still consider HOnda's to be bulletproof are many:1) It was a first year model and not built in Japan2) The japanese built/assembled Civics we've had have been bulletproof and required no return visits, thats is 0 visits.3) It was for things like window moldings rippling and wrinkling and a powerseat that functioned but ""bumped"" a tad bit at the end of its ""track."" I'm picky.4) It had two rattle sources to deal with.These are forgiveable offenses; what isn't forgiveable are things that leave you stranded because the car won't start (never happened with any Honda) or things that cost you money you shouldn't have to spend (Honda steps up if something does go wrong, even after warranty).So Hip hip hooray for Honda!  But, alas... I did go with a German car, and I might not have if the Accord had been perfect rather than near perfect. "

definitely a tough call... both are very fast, have good suspensions for solid handling, good transmissions in both. perhaps AWD might be an issue depending on where you live and how much you push the car when cornering (I'm of the view that an AWD car can be pushed harder quicker after the apex than a FWD car could). I've heard in the recent past that the mazdaspeed6 could be had for 5k+ off msrp, but I don't know if that's still the case... geuss it depends on where you live and the availability of this model in your market. I'd say the MS6 would have a tiny bit of a performance edge especially in steering feel, cornering and braking and it looks slightly better (and I think will ""age"" better) but the Altima would probably have more creature comforts since it has more room, push start, quieter, and slightly softer suspension. So I geuss it comes down to how much sportiness do you want in your sporty sedan? btw... have you looked at the legacy gt? "

""...So in your opinion, the resale value of the new Tundra is horrible because they almost immediately went to $3000 rebates or 0% financing due to sub-par sales? ""Look at it logically (and this works for any vehicle):You have a one year old model, and it is totaled, stolen, or you just had to sell/trade... the value of your car as determined by most pricing books, an insurance adjuster, used car manager, appraiser or private buyer, etc. will roughly be:The average selling price of a brand new model, less any incentives currently available, minus a percentage (say, 10-30% based on other factors of depreciation such as current demand and past history).So if the new versions of your one year old model are still selling well at close to MSRP with no incentives, your resale value will be just fine. Alternately, if the new models are selling at invoice or less plus have heavy incentives, than the value of your one year old model has to be adjusted down accordingly. In the case of the Tundra, I'd say yes, their resale value won't be great (maybe not horrible, but not great) until Toyota stops the discounting and/or incentives.I'll admit, I think this means that right now, my 2007 Accord with 6k miles is worth slightly less than a 2007 Altima with 6k miles, because an Altima with the same MSRP will cost you more new (less discounts, no factory to dealer incentives that I am aware of). That's OK, because I paid less. However, later this year when the 2008 Accords are out and the deals on the 2007s have dried up, the two 2007 cars should be roughly equal in resale value again.Of course this is all relative... If you bought your car before any discounting/incentives began or just didn't buy right, then you'll be more affected than someone who took advantage of all the discounts/incentives.

Ha...well, one of the three, yes--the Alero was not a well built or particulary well executed car, though it did look pretty decent.I had an Intrigue with the 3.5L. It WAS a good car--fun to drive, very good powertrain, nice features. It just didn't hold up well. The Maxx is also pretty well designed--there is an amazing amount of room in it, its very useful, fuel efficient and a good value. Again, durability is a problem--particularly the brakes. But we'll be holding on to that car for a while--it only has 26k.My point here though is that you can't have a discussion about these cars without considering the history of their manufacturer. Some have more to prove than others.And btw--overall first year reliability of the Camry has been above average. And I'm willing to bet it will be for the Accord too. The Fusion has been a pleasant surprise, but I'd still want to see data from the next couple of years before being completely confident.

From Wikipedia:""Ford Motor Company's modern 2.5 L and 3.0 L V6 automobile engines are evolutions of the same design, first used in the 1994 Ford Mondeo. This line is sold under the brand name ""Duratec"", as are many other engines.The Mondeo V6 is a modern aluminum DOHC V6 with a 60° bank angle. The primary engineering input came from Porsche, who were developing a similar V6 before selling the engineering to Ford, and Cosworth, who helped with cylinder head manufacturing. The Jaguar AJ-V6 engine is similar but adds variable valve timing. Mazda's AJ version also has this feature.""Duratec 30""The 3.0 L Duratec 30 or Mazda AJ was introduced in 1996 as a replacement for the 232 in³ (3.8 L) Essex V6 in the Taurus/Sable. It has 2967 cc of displacement and produces between 200 and 240 hp (150 and 180 kW). The same basic engine is used in the Jaguar S-Type, Lincoln LS, Mazda MPV, Mazda6, Mondeo ST220 and many other Ford vehicles. It is essentially a bored-out (to 89 mm) Duratec 25 and is built in Ford Motor Company's Cleveland, OH #2 plant. A slightly modified version for the Ford Five Hundred entered production at the Cleveland, OH #1 plant in 2004.There are two key versions of the Duratec 30:DAMB - The Lincoln LS and Jaguar AJ30 versions have direct-acting mechanical bucket (DAMB) tappets. Output is 232 hp (173 kW) at 6750 RPM with 220 ft·lbf (298 N·m) of torque at 4500 rpm.

Not to mention all the 2005 Toyota recallsWhat recalls would those be? Don't think they actually recalled even the sludging problem they had on the previous generation of V6s. Recalls, in fact, tend to be related to safety issues. There has been a whole 1 recall on my 05 Avalon TMK (a steering column weld) and a coupla of non-safety related TSBs (Tranny programming and a timing chain cover leak). The car is actually doing better (after over 50k) that I would have anticipated being a completely new car with, at that time, an unproven drivetrain. Broke a cardinal rule (never buy a truly new model its first year), and only something that I would've even considered with a Toyota/Honda/Nissan product. So far so good. The same thing with a GM/Ford/Chrysler product? No way, I'll continue to trust a long established history! "

I prefer to see this particular glass of water as being half full instead of half empty. The refined 3.0-liter, 221-horsepower V6 Duratec engine in our 2007 Fusion produces plenty of ""git up and go,"" is smooth and quiet while doing so.Gas mileage, however, is not so good when coupled with AWD. It's 14.8 in all-city driving after seven months and 3,700 miles on the car. The revised EPA estimate for this power train is 17 mpg city; 24 mpg highway. Nothing to write home about.Without AWD, 3.0-liter V6 owners typically get 20 mpg in town, according to the forums I visit. I fully expect this 2007 Fusion to last seven or eight years. "

the prices seem about right for both, and both cars with a manual tranny be ready for a little tugging at the steering wheel. The Altima rates near (or at the top of its class -including Accords) depreciation wise - so if you are not likely to be keeping the car for 7+ years,the Altima should win hands down from a cost to own perspective. The Nissan VQ is still perhaps the most proven and reliable V6 available , while I'd be hesitant to buy a turbocharged anything. And yes, I own a 03 3.5SE (auto) 25-26 mpg overall, 75k, and never been back to the dealer for anything - the way it should be. EXCEPT for some collison repairs after my wife got rearended - which is how I found out about the resale values, the darn insurance co. wouldn't total it because THEY thought it was still worth substantially more than the $11k it took to fix it. The wife, of course, had her heart set on a new 07 model at the time and STILL DOES even though they did a good job on the repairs. Somehow, I think I'm going to lose this battle - again! I did get a chance to drive the new 08, found that the interior quality/fit & finish had improved tremendously - thought the CVTs behavior was a bit disconcerting, although I know she would love it - it is smoooooth. MTXs, of course, in big city traffic, out of the question for her and me. "

Resale value is just part of the car sales game, invented decades ago by GM. (Buy a GM and you'll get top $ on a trade in.) That was before many people knew about how to buy a new car. The GM guy would give a top $ trade-in value against the MSRP (or near MSRP) of a new GM car. Trade-in a Ford, Chrysler or Rambler on a GM and they'd hose you on both ends of the deal. Peopel who plan on keeping a new car for 5 or more years shouldn't be concerned with resale or trade-in value. In my state, CT, if a car is totaled the insurance company has to pay retail used car value. A couple months ago I looked at retail value of my '05 Sonata and it was only ~ $2,000 less than what I paid in April '05. I paid $4 or $5K less than a comparable camcord would have cost. Tell me where I'm taking a beating on depreciation. "

The bigger point I was making was that when buying certain cars that were/are being discounted heavily, this can help reduce the impact of depreciation if a buyer was concerned about buying a certain car because of bad resale value. There has been lots of talk in this thread that buying a camcord has the added advantage that resale values are higher thus the true cost to own calculations benefit camcords... but my experience shows that if a buyer is able to buy a car that is heavily discounted, this benefit can be flipped where the advantage is actually with the heavily discounted car, in this case, my mazda6 has an amazing resale value because I was able to buy it at a hugely reduced price. Since you don't know what the advequitguy bought his Mazdaspeed6 for relative to MSRP, you can't possibly have enough info to draw any useful conclusions.... and in the future captain2, I'd appreciate if you'd make an attempt to characterize what others have written accurately rather than twisting their words to make a point that they weren't.

If its performance you want, I'd have to go with the altima. Gotta love that VQ. But, if your primary concern is price, you'd almost deffinitly get the 6 either for less, or same with more options.Have you driven the MS6? Trust me, the performance edge in this comparison clearly favors the MS6. A turbo 4-cylinder feeding AWD is my choice compared to a nose-heavy FWD. Don't get me wrong, the VQ is indeed a great engine, but the handling of the Altima leaves a little to be desired compared to a regular Mazda6, and a LOT with the MS6. The previous-gen has terrible torque-steer, which gets a little unnerving in a corner. The '07 has toned down the TS, but it still floats more on the highway and rolls more than the 6 in the twisties.For a sedan with good performance, practicality and a broader appeal, the Altima is your choice. For a sedan that handles better than some sports cars, a powerful turbocharged engine with AWD, and still can seat 4 comfortably, pick the MS6.BTW, it isn't difficult to get a MS6 Sport for $1500 less (or more) than the Altima...

Buying a car with the intent to sell it in three years based on what you believe to be the future asking price can lead to some surprises. all true, you have to wonder how these leasing cos. can project residual values (and therefore lease payment sizes) reliably when a particular car is just out. I just can't imagine that even Mazda/FoMoCo) would have had any idea a few years back, that the 6, for example, would be having to be sold at $6k+ discounts and thus, the residual values would be in the dumper. Guess it must get to be a function of Mazda/Ford (if they are the lessor) ""taking it on the chin"" much in the same way that they do when they discount it that much to begin with? Buying any brand of vehicle with a 'suspect' past in terms of future values is a helluva gamble but at least we do have a 'red flag' - that being that that it is being sold for any number significantly below invoice.

Not a Mazda6, but a real-world, private-party scenario.My 1998 Mazda 626 ES V6 had an original MSRP of $23,240 and an original invoice of $20,933.

This represents approximately 50% depreciation in 4 years.I drove the car 2 and 1/2 additional years and put another 45k miles on it, selling it in December 2003 for $5,700, or 30% of it's original value.

whule I certainly agree with your historical perspectives, the Duratechs have been around for well over 10 yrs. if you also include the original 2.5s. Say what you want about the 'competitiveness' of the current 3.0, but reliabilility and durability of it has gotten quite good. It's when Ford decides to (or is able to) replace the engine with something truly new that I'm guessing those teething problems would logically appear. The 3.6 in the Saturn is a truly new engine that did fortunately spend some time under CTS hoods much like the Camry V6 had already spent some time under Avalon hoods (and others). As such, the jury must still be considered out on those particular engines especially relative to things like the current Honda V6, the 'ancient' Nissan VQ, and yes, even that 'ancient' DT. "

And if you were to read my original post, I listed the private party value for my Mazda6 which was $2200 off what I paid for it. Not bad for 18 months and 20k miles... but oh yeah, you don't like to paraphrase what other people write correctly, so I'll make it clear to everyone else. Here's where I take issue with your disputing KBB's valuations of cars. On the one hand you bring up the advantages of certain cars by mentioning Edmund's True Cost of Ownership, which uses (among other things) used car values to determine the TCO. So in this situation you accept these used car values to draw conclusions about the cost of owning one of these cars. But in this instance, you are now saying that these used car valuations are junk and should be ignored... well captain2, you can't have it both ways. And as a side note, when I got preapproved to get a loan for a used car, guess what the bank used to determine the maximum amount that they would loan me for a certain car... you guessed it, Kelly Blue Book. Regarding your mentioning that person with the Speed6 and his inability to get what he wanted from a dealer on trade in... First of all, when does a dealer ever give a fair trade in value at first... pretty much never. And how do you know how far into the negotiation he got? And how do you know how good of a negotiator he was anyway? Second, you have no idea what condition his car was in... was it damaged or abused? Third, you don't know what the dealer offered him. Maybe that guy has the idea that he should get all of his money back and anything less is unreasonable... of course to expect this would be absurd, but how do you know if this guys expectations are realistic or not? Fourthly, how do you know what he paid for his car in the first place? If you don't know that, how can you judge what ""reasonable value back"" is? And you have not tried to dispute the point in the three responses you've written to my first post that brought up the point that the more of a discount you get on a car, the less of a hit you will get when it comes to resale. Since you have not tried to dispute this, you must agree that you have no basis to judge whether the amount offered for his used car was realistic, fair, or reasonable. "

Yeah, I love Subies... the car I owned prior to the Mazda6 was a 1996 Legacy GT wagon. I have some very fond memories of driving it in Southern Cal on hwy 1 along the windy roads overlooking the pacific coast... that was a ton of fun (except for all the stuff in the back that was sliding from side to side...a half gallon of water must have sloshed out of my cooler lol). Here in the NW there are tons of subies around and this demand kept me from getting the deal I wanted on a 05 legacy gt. Really an amazing car. A friend of mine just got an Outback (non turbo) and it's really nice. As a side note, my legacy had 160k miles on it, and I sold it for 5.4k and it was advertized for less than a day. "

My 1998 Mazda 626 ES V6 had an original MSRP of $23,240 and an original invoice of $20,933. The car had the standard manual transmission, sunroof, leather, power seats, BOSE CD, ABS brakes, and alloy wheels. In June of 2001, with 50k miles, the original owner attempted to sell it for $12,500 but had no interest. He sold it at his reduced asking price of $10,500. This represents approximately 50% depreciation in 4 years. What did he actually pay for it when new? If it were discounted like the Mazda6, perhaps he paid $5000 (or more)below MSRP, as a number of Mazda6 buyers have. That would mean he would have paid around $18,000 and depreciation was about 42%. This was also a manual, which makes selling it a lot more difficult. "

aah so! OK I take it all back, and I'll be right behind you (and FoMoCo) into the depths of Chapter 7 as we all make (lose?) a fortune buying and selling used (and new) Mazda6s! As I said it just doesn't happen and nor is any car (yes, even those Camcords) ever a good investment from any reasonable strictly financial viewpoint. In terms of believing a Camcords probable resale value projections vs. anything else in this group (other than the Altima, which also ranks very high on the ole used desirability list) - all you really have to do is actually try to sell (or buy) one vs the other - and then you will see how close your treasured KBB retail/private party/tradein numbers really are - in both cases. Let me know when that happens to you, then I will apologize profusely for challenging any of these ridiculous contentions you make! As it is right now a Mazda6 should hold its value about as well as a Sonata - really lofty territory don't you think? Things like $6k discounts on $20k new cars do things like that. "

I like the interior shot! Looks at least better than the new Altima's interior.Kinda makes me wonder if Nissan will have to do another ""Interior 2.0"" like they did with the 05 Altima. This time it wouldn't be because of materials, it would be because of the spartan design.I like the new Altima, but the more I see new competitors hit the market, the more I worry that Nissan played it too safe with the Altima's redesign. The front end (which looks like it's smiling) isn't nearly aggresive enough, the styling looks too similar to the previous generation.Even the Sonata is getting a more cohesive inteior next year...I'm definitely worried about Nissan.

once again, since you can't seem to respond to what I've actually written and instead insist on making things up or divert into childish sarcism, I'll just make the point that these are not my resale value #'s...they are KBB's. If you have an issue with their valueations, feel free to show me some data that supports your point. Since banks, car dealerships, and magazines use KBB to figure things like TCO, this suggests that many people familiar with this industry feel that KBB is a good guide to car resale values. Until you can come up with more than your own personal hunch as to why KBB should be discredited, you're just flailing around in this argument and not making any contact with the issues at hand.

Was/is a longer warranty a significant factor to anyone? When I shopped, it really wasn't. I thought it would be nice to have a 4 or 5 year warranty, but in the end it really did not matter.I probably did give a little more consideration, than I otherwise would have to Sonata due to the warranty. Due to the warranty, I even gave very brief consideration to the Galant, but never did even test drive one...partly because the dealer is in an inconvenient location.Just wonder if anyone bought or is planning to buy model X instead of model Y specifically because of a long warranty.

That seems like a contradiction. You say ""don't even consider the warranty"" and then said you spent 20 minutes dickering over the price of an extended warranty before you bought it.Sounds to me like you wanted a warranty that was better than what Nissan included as standard.Hyundai's unmatched warranty was important to me. Four months before I bought my Sonata in April '05, I started researching cars. One of the things that attracted me to test drive a Sonata was the warranty. The more I researched, the more it became apparent that Hyundai was a ""player.""My car has been fantastic. Not one thing has had to be adjusted or corrected in 27 months and ~15,300 miles. My brother now has an '07 Sonata, a friend has an '07 Azera (& 2 months after ownership bought his college age son an '02 Sonata w/ 15K miles) and he referred a co-worker who bought an '07 Tuscon.The warranty is meaningful to some people.

I paid for an extended warranty once, back in 91. All that $600 got me was a new temperature control knob. If I think the car is unreliable, I don't want.

He seems to just want to buy another junker, which I think is the best choice for him. But I have been letting him know his other options. One of which would be buy a car with a 5 year warranty and pay for it over 5 years. The extra expense of interest and the need for collision insurance is partly offset by having no repair costs.I think for someone with a limited budget the 5 year warranty makes going with a 5 year loan safer. That is assuming they do not drive so many miles that the 5 years become 3 or something. "

I've owned 2 other nissan vehicles, and never used the extended warranty. not even once. so this time, I figured why waste the money? However, the dealership had different plans. when they gave me the final price, I told them it was high, to drop the warranty. they spent 20 minutes trying to talk me into buying one. we weren't dickering over price. they just kept lowering it because my intial reason for decling it was that it was a waste of money, which, for the most part, i thought it was. But for some reason, the dealership was hell bent on me getting an extended warranty. so, after 20 minutes of them twisting my arm, lowering the price of the warranty, and lowering other charges in order to get the car priced the same with the warranty as it would have been without it.............I gave in and took it.

Jeffyscott- I think you are very wise for considering insurance costs in that budget. Another thing to consider is how handy or willing to work on the car himself is he? Older vehicles have a ""nickel and dime"" tendency, but most of those things are reasonably easy to repair DIY. If the Accord (which is old) had to go in for service every time something broke, there is no way I could afford that car and the monthly maintenance cost would be more than a car payment (and perhaps the insurance cost would be offset by not having to spend time repairing it).At this point, unfortunately my time is becoming more valuable, keeping up with the vehicle repair is getting too much, and that monthly cost is approaching a car payment, so that is putting me in the market for something newer.

He earns ~$150 per week and does not spend much, so he can afford the occassional repair. So the trade-off is $500-1000 per year in repairs vs. higher insurance costs and car payments. OTOH, if he has collision coverage he will limit his losses should he have another accident. OTOOH, if he has another accident insurance costs may explode...in fact, that may already be in the works, since it was officially a single vehicle accident.

I do wonder if ESC might have helped, though Yup, it would've kept him going head first straight into the k-barrier :P (I'm just kidding, although that is a reasonable possibility)It sounds like his experience is typical of where the vehicle off road crashes happen. When the car leaves the roadway and tries to get back on, a bunch of bad stuff starts happening. This is also one of the easiest ways to roll an SUV, as joining the roadway from a low shoulder may be enough to provide the ""trip"" to roll it. Its very scary stuff. One of the things they told us at the HPDEs is ""if you go off, stay off,"" which was basically saying if you exist the course (or roadway or whatever) to get the vehicle completely under control (and slowed) before rejoining the roadway; there have been a number of times I have seen a vehicle go spinning off on the inside of a course (with an open field and no obstacles) only to fight its way back onto the course while the driver didn't have enough directional control of the vehicle and would hit the inside wall sideways.

One of which would be buy a car with a 5 year warranty and pay for it over 5 years. The extra expense of interest and the need for collision insurance is partly offset by having no repair costs. The truth, though, is that you can get a ""beater"" that's a perfectly fine car for less than $6000 that's only a few years old. Of course, it will be a Ford or GM midsize sedan, but they are safe and get reasonably well mileage as well.Say he gets a $9995 Chevy Aveo(5 year drivetrain) - about as cheap as it gets new. It's going to kill him in payments and not be either as safe or as nice as say, an 7-8 year old LeSabre or a 5-6 year old Grand Marquis.Grand Marquis GS($6,000)Manufacturer Rebates:Net Cost: $17,879That's new. Used:http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?car_id=221055456Yes, 6.5 years old and $5995. New makes no sense at all for someone on such a limited budget. I boubt if he's going to abuse it even half as bad a a taxi driver or police officer.Fuel cost is minimal as well, so mpg is moot. - what he needs at 20 years old is sometihng to get to school and work. He's not putting on 20,000 miles a year(at least I hope he's not - lol)Actually, I'd go OLD. Classic and dirt cheap to work on. Pre-smog, and pre-computers. Like an old Volvo 140. Engine is bulletproof, rest of the car can be worked on for almost nothing. Get one of the 1976 or older models as there isn't any computers or smog equipment to really speak of. It's virtually the same as a Volvo 240, just with carbs and stuff you can fix yourself.Or you can always find an older 1970s domestic. Something that loks retro and he can fix and modify a bit - without losing too much value. There's a reason college students tend to drive old heaps like this.

Those new found sales for the Impala are mostly rental fleet. 53.9% for the first half of 2007 were fleet sales of one sort or another. The Honda Accord was 4.9%, so there you have it, you decide. Altima 16.4% fleet - big deal ! The Impala found some new retail customers when it change the look inside and out. The freshen up was a good one. More advertising and a longer warranty also helped. It however is no match for the foreign competition. The car is what it is. A bit larger, good for a company car or renting for a vacation.The New Malibu is going to do better than the Aura, no doubt.

As I said, if the Impala (regardless of fleet sales) can be sold in great numbers, who's to say a Malibu which is significantly better than the Impala, and better than the Aura can't do the same thing? Each year those fleets sales have went down for the Impala, so it's a sign that retail sales for the Impala are actually improving.I never mentioned anything about the Accord's fleet sales, which I knew would be low. But I do believe that the new Malibu will be a true competitor, more so of a competitor than the Fusion, Aura or Sonata mainly because of Chevy's big dealer network and the fact that the car is soooo much better than the current model. I also feel that the Malibu's styling is going to attract some people to and that it's interior (with it's elements of cheapness) is unique because it offers so many color schemes. Some features of the Malibu are missing (Nav, Bluetooth, etc) but I feel the car is going to be competitive otherwise, just like the Aura is...but it will be a MUCH better seller than the Aura because it has a bigger network of dealers, a competitive V6, I4/6spd auto combo on the LTZ, and more competitive pricing than the Aura has.We'll have to wait it out and see...but in the meantime, as an owner of the previous generation Altima, I'm still worried about the car.Has anyone seen this pic of the new 'Bu? I'm feeling it.Either way I can't wait until all these new cars get here! A new Accord in Sept, around the same time we get to see the new Mazda6 in Geneva.

I thought it would be interesting to post a video of my Accord accelerating from 5 to 80 MPH. This way everyone can hear what it sounds like when it sings its song, sort of share in the experience. We've certainly done enough talking about acceleration, engine noise, etc... now watch the video.This was filmed at a rest stop. I started rolling at 5 MPH in the truck lane which merges with the car lane that becomes the onramp. You can see a white Expedition pass by in the car lane a few seconds before I begin my run. Before even reaching the end of the ramp, I've caught the Expedition and have to merge all the way over into the fast lane on the freeway, coming up on a car which is going 80 MPH. There was plenty of lane left. It certainly was fun.LINK TO VIDEO ON CARSPACEThe car feels much faster than the spec sheet suggests.

Every car has one or two things better or worse than the next when you start doing all the research and test drives. As a whole the Aura is good - the Accord is good IMHO. The Fusion / Milan is pretty good. Your values may vary.I would expect resale on the Aura to be lower than an Accord. And while they thought the hot seller to be the XE, more people seem to like the XR than GM had planned. Considering the components in total and performance as a whole, the XR beats out the XE. Not sure why they have this car, since a less expensive New Malibu with an i4 is on the way.Loren "

I'm definitely worried about NissanNissan has purportedly the PROFITABLE car lines of all the manufactuerers (they do a real good job with platform/drivetrain sharing), the Altima is a solid no. 3 in this class in terms of sales (almost matching the Accord), and also rates very very well in terms of residual values, besting the Accord. And they have perhaps the guy running the outfit available. CR has the Altima as its top rated midsize (tied with the Accord) What's to worry?While I'll agree that earlier Altimas did not have interiors up to the same quality as Camcords, the new model is much much better. I believe they may have some difficulty however with public acceptance of the fuel efficient CVT - it should either be a big hit or a big flop. "

I find it puzzling to be "" definitely worried about Nissan"" based on the new Altima. Although I can't think of a truly scientific way to judge the success or appeal of a vehicle based on knowledge that is available in the public arena, here's my best attempt:-CYTD sales of the Altima are up 18.4%-Fleet sales (most recent available, 6 mo. 09/06 - 02/07) of the NEW Altima are 16.5%-According to the July 9 Auto News, Factory to Dealer and Factory to Consumer incentives were minimal, and much lower than those for the &#146;06 Altima at this time last yearSo, even assuming that every single one of the 2006 went to a consumer and not fleet (obviously not the case), sales are STILL up vs. the '06, and consumers are paying HIGHER prices. Now consider:-CYTD through June, Accord sales are up-CYID through June, Camry sales are upThis shows that while these models still dominate, it&#146;s not like &#150; in particular re: the Accord &#150; this is a momentary spike in Altima sales due to the lack of appeal from other models. If anything, the fact that the Altima can grow share while the Honda piles on factory to dealer Accord incentives to move inventory, is a sign of strength, in my opinion.Finally:- Consumer Reports recently put the Altima (4 and V6) at or near the top of their class. While *I know* that everyone on this board is a far better consumer (so spare me the flaming) and considers a million and one things before purchase, other, less enthusiast-like consumers will see that report, and that&#146;s all they need to know.- The Altima has introduced a coupe for 2008, broadening the appeal to consumers by offering more model variations- The Altima now offers a hybrid, vs. last generation- For those who care about safety, ABS is now standard, which I think was one of the most detrimental aspects of the more basic Altimas.So, based on all of this, where does the ""worry"" come from? Certainly while I&#146;m not against the continual improving of product, I simply think that the new Altima, to date, is quite successful, and shrewdly positioned for the future &#150; including the new Accord, Malibu, 6, et al.[If any model launch should give Nissan pause, it&#146;s the Sentra, and potentially the Versa&#146;s role in that dramatic sales plummet] "

less enthusiast-like consumers will see that report, and that&#146;s all they need to know. right on the mark here - CR likely the single most influential opinion on any car - whether it deserves to be, or whether we 'enthusiasts' happen to agree with their particular priorities is not the point, it remains a Bible of sorts for many. The strange part of this - CR was not all that excited about the new Camry except for the Hybrid (of course) but it hasn't seemed to hurt sales - the majority of which are 4 banger LEs. "

If the Ford Fusion -- or any other mid-size sedan for that matter -- received the highest awards for all categories from all testers and went from 0-60 in 6 seconds flat, delivered 40 mpg in city driving, etc., etc. it still wouldn't create much of a dent in Toyota Camry and Honda Accord sales, IMHO.Why? Because Camry and Accord have such a fine track record that they get an enormous amount of repeat business from satisfied owners.At this point, FoMoCo, GM, Chrysler would have to build the best mid-size sedan for 10 years running before pulling even with the Camry and Accord. Their lead is almost insurmountable.

See..... people buy Camry's and Accord's because they know they won't break down. Reliability is one of the main selling points of the Camcords. If you put in a warranty for 10 years and 100K, plus you say we'll pay you if you need to use it, and even more if you have to use it a lot, then you'll steal sales away from Toyota and Honda immediately.In fact, you'll take an insurmountable lead against their seemingly insurmountable lead.

Actually, the Passat tops CR's family car ratings for 4 cylinder cars and the Accord, Passat, and Altima are tied for 1st for V6s. Interestingly, for the 4s the Camry Hybrid, at $30,667 the most expensive 4 cylinder car on CR's list, is ranked 3rd, but the Optima tied the non-hybrid Camry.

No, people buy Camcords because they have a history of satisfied ownership which includes much better than average reliability. Boz is right - a satisfied Camcord owner isn't likely to look elsewhere unless they have a bad experience. It will take years, maybe decades to win over any significant percentage of those buyers unless the Camcords continue to have problems like the engine sludge and transmission problems or the styling, features or pricing get way out of line.Ford's best hope is to continue to keep quality high and to continue to make improvements every 3-4 years so that a Fusion owner looking for something new has a new model to consider. If the 2010 model looks just like the 2006 model then current customers will look elsewhere for something new. This is where the Camcords have succeeded the last 20 years. And that's why the 2009 Fusion refresh is so critical. "

Passat tops the rankings for 4 cylinders by one point, indeed, but IMO is out of contention because of its abysmal reliability rating (reference the black dot). Pending a strong showing by the Altima (and it has never in its history fallen below 'Average' by CR), it will be the highest rated 4 cyl. recommended model..... until the likes of the new Accord, Malibu, et al. are tested. And even if the Altima V6 is TIED at the top (which it is), it is still at the TOP....FWIW, the Camry Hybrid is now also available for $25,800, if you can forgo alloys, JBL/6CD, electrochromatic rearview, and the leather, moonroof, and NAV options of the CR test vehicle.

Weird how the 4-cylinder Passat has an ""abysmal"" reliability score from CR but the V6 is fine and is Recommended by CR.I have a feeling CR will test and report on the new Accord ASAP, since it is so popular, maybe the Malibu also. So the Altima's position as ""top-ranked Recommended 4 cylinder family car"" could be very short.Nearly all (or maybe all?) of the family cars CR tested are available for less than the tested price--almost all for thousands less than the Camry Hybrid's starting price. But an Altima costing $8000 less than the Camry Hybrid out-pointed it. In the V6 group, the Accord was over $4000 less than each of the other two top-ranked cars. "

Well I had heard of VW's with oil consumption problems, so before considering a Rabbit or Jetta, I thought to ask the salesman what they considered oil consumption under warranty issues. He referred me to the service dept, which confirmed what I had heard that the 8/10 qt. per 1,ooo miles is the limit acceptable. And you break in a VW engine, as in a rather slow break in period, as in these must be old technology engines, IMHO. Too each his own, but I am not interested in these four banger or now five banger engines if they may start consuming oil. Now it is very well possible that broken in correctly, few if any will consume oil. Anyone out there which owned several of these VW's over the years care to chime in? I am going by what you hear off the chat rooms, complaints issued listed on the Net, and just what the warranty considers as excessive. Japan engines use less than a quarter per 5,ooo miles.

Also, the gas flap fit so tightly, it wouldn't always open on the first push of the lever when it was new, and required adjustment. All within 1,000 miles. Brand new Honda. Two (very minor) issues.

VW also noted for sludging issues as well as consumption, and it should be noted that Nissan also had an oil consumption issue (on its 4 banger) that led to a recall, something I believe Nissan handled properly. The VW V6 is every bit as high tech and almost as efficient as the Toyota 2GR IMO, don't have any idea why the 'old fashioned' break-in period requirements or FTM why the 4 banger should be showing a poor track record unless, of course, its related to the turbocharged versions. The Passat V6 is one sweet driving car (great power/reasonable FE) combined with some 'tight' handling - high relative price and lower relative resale seem to hurt it. Perhaps it should be included in this group. "

If, or when the New Malibu should outsell the Altima, then what? Actually, it doesn't matter how many GM sell, if it is not for a profit. Seems to me that they are still competing against themselves when offering the G6, then the Aura, and now the New Malibu. I take it the G6 ends once the Pontiac go all RWD drive series. Isn't the Saab 9-3 another car based on this platform of the G6, or visa-versa? Anyway, a lot of cars the same width, which makes the interior a skosh smaller than say the Accord or Camry. I don't care for those darn floor pedal emergency brakes. And support rods for engine hoods are old hat. All in all, the new series is good though, with so far the Aura XR being the value leader when discounted some $1,500 or $1750 during sales. The New Malibu should successfully kill off the Aura XE, and G6 sedans; not sure about the Aura XR.The New Malibu should be a good car. Now they need to build an awesome car which looks like an American icon quality again. The shape of the Malibu will be pleasing. Lots of that on the road however from every make in the World.

My take on this:Aura should have been the same as the Opel, sold as such by Saturn, while building the cars here and overseas. There is no real Saturn, as in those funny little plastic cars (no ding doors-neat idea), which were very unique. Those are gone and the new cars are all metal, and versions of other cars.Malibu should have been RWD if the new Impala is going RWD and a tad wider inside, sold in three versions, a base i4 for price, a V6 with goodies, and a sport version for enthusiasts. The car should be in a coupe and sedan version, selling from $18,500 to $25,500 range with sport package and goodies. IF the New Malibu is FWD, why then the RWD Impala? Considering the lower end, and it being smaller, perhaps the Malibu is really more of a Nova -- just a thought.G6 could be dropped. The Pontiac goes Aussie cars in RWD.Saab may always have a following, but those are small numbers, unless they tax the engine displacement in USA. Where is the room mate for Saabs? Is it Cadillac, Ponitac or Saturn? Someone, please adopt this pet.CTS should have a coupe model.Loren "

I don't see Chevy making the Malibu RWD anytime soon. That would be foolish considering the Malibu is a volume seller (fleets and othewise) Chevy has the highest brand recognition and the biggest dealer network.Chevy is GM's largest brand and GM as a company needs to keep at least one fully mainstream sedan to compete head to head with the likes of the Accord and Camry. Making the Malibu RWD would be a bad idea. That would leave the Aura as the only real FWD midsize offered and Aura sales are disappointing at best. Also, you have to remember that a LOT of folks don't want RWD. Further, from what I've been reading about the RWD, 2009 (or is it 2010?) Camaro, GM is having a tough time bringing the platform cost down so that a base Camaro V6 can be offered for $25K. That same platform would not be available for a RWD Malibu for about $18.5K. What other RWD platform could they use and remain cost efficient? Offering a RWD Full Size Impala and a FWD Midsize Malibu is probably GM's best bet that way you take care of the biggest market of sedans (FWD Midsize Sedans) which Chevy has GOT to be in to be succesful and the growing, revitalized RWD full size market (300, Charger, soon Aussie Fords)From what I've read, the G6 isn't going anywhere as far as it's name is concerned. Pontiac is doing the whole ""alphanumeric"" thing so even if the next Midsize Sedan were to go RWD (outside of the new G8) the name will still end up being G6 b/c they can't call it a G5 or G4. G6 name is likely to remain. I'd propose the following:Malibu=FWD, offered with I4/6spd combo throughout (Not just LTZ models) and V6/6spd combo as it will be. Malibu should compete completely head to head with the Accord and Camry offering similar options, similar power.Aura=FWD, should compete more along the lines with the Mazda6, Nissan Altima, Suby Legacy. Maybe offer AWD on it (if that's possible) Aura should be the sportier alternative to the Malibu, with Euro handling and a more euro looks (from spy shots of the next Vectra, we may get an Aura like this)G6=Competely RWD, a poor man's BMW.That way no one is stepping on anybody's toes.

I punched in my zip code and preferred make and it listed dealers that were way out of my comfortable range and the one that is actually close to me is now closed and the building has been sold to WalMart. There are 3 dealers for the make I chose that are a lot closer to my house and they weren't on the list. I never heard of a couple of the dealers the system listed actually. :surprise: "

Well then, make the Impala FWD. Pontiac could then be the all RWD and Performance division. Personally, I think while the New Malibu may do well in the market, they are wasting so much time, money and energy taking on Honda and Toyota say, one on one. Just make a cool looking car like the CTS for the masses. People buy for various reasons, but the style is important, if you are not going to extremes to outdo the competition on the track. If they really make those Holden Pontiac imports drop dead gorgeous, then perhaps they will sell like hotcakes. I am afraid other cars like the Aura and New Malibu, while being OK for content have no major look appeal to separate them from all the rest. First GM did the head butt routine with VW, then Japan, and now must have a major sized headache from doing so. Leave the head butts for the animals in the wild and do the cool little side step, and dance around the competition while they are left standing in place.Loren "

Keeping the Impala FWD would also be a mistake because Chevy is GM's biggest, most recognized brand in the US with the biggest dealer network so it's cars have to be able to reach every market. So whereever the competition goes, so must Chevy go. Chevy has to be the ""all around brand"" for GM with a mix of crossover SUVs, Full size SUVs, midsize FWD sedans (since there are no real affordable RWD midsize family sedans today), RWD full size sedans, Trucks, and of course the RWD Camaro. They also need more competitive compacts, and subcompacts. Just out of curiosity, if Chevy were to make a CTS for the masses, what exactly would happen to Cadillac & Buick?Truth is exterior styling is not all that important to most buyers. If style was important the Mazda6 & Aura would be better sellers, probably allowing the Altima (which is already a graet seller) to outsell the Camcords. If GM can design a soild, nicely styled Malibu, soon offer a two-mode hybrid, the I4/6spd auto combo on all models (not just the LTZ) and keep the 3.6 competitive, eventually offer bluetooh, nav and dual-zone climate control and I think the car will be successful.Pontiac should go RWD competely, but focus mainly on SportBuick should continue to appeal to the older crowd. Cadillac go RWD/AWD competely (which they plan to do) and focus on Luxury and performance.Saturn should continue to be the ""Euro"" brand, somewhere between mainstream Chevy and Sporty Pontiac.That way GM can focus it's money on marketing and improving cars like the Malibu, Aura, G6 and Lacrosse, while keeping them from competiting with each other head to head.

Chevy / GM should start building a car slightly smaller than a CTS, in RWD for the masses. No, not a CTS look alike, but another very modern, very uniquely styled car, which could be sold for under $24K for the masses. It would not effect the CTS or Buick lines all that much. Well not as much as the New Malibu being the demise of the G6 sedan and the Aura XE base, plastic hubcap models. The next Nova should be stylish, RWD and handle well. For those not interested in these qualities, you have all the rest to choose from. And that is ultimately the problem. Aura is a good car? Well yeah, but there is all the rest. If it had a different look and RWD, it would be kickin' some butt as I type this. So who should Saab team up with? Is it Pontiac, Saturn or the current parring with Cadillac?Loren "

Have you driven the Aura XR yet? I would value it around $21,999 as a pretty fair value. Sure, a large hit is taken come resale time, but what can you do. I guess if you could get it for say $20K, that would be an equalizer of sort. A fear one may have of owning the XR is that the New Malibu does become wildly popular in the 3.6 model and it sells a thousand or two below the price of the XR Aura. That would hurt. Anyway, Saturn may sell you an Astra for $15,ooo, or maybe not. Anyone know the pricing of the little guy yet?Loren "

The RWD models with V6 engines are just plain slow.IIRC, the last test of a Chrysler 300 Touring (with the 3.5L V6) ran 0-60 in 7.3 seconds (in a Car and Driver 6-way comparo of full-size sedans - the 300 placed 3rd of 6). That's not plain slow to me. In fact, it's faster than my Accord, which is plenty peppy.What is so great about RWD anyway? I don't see the benefit.

Well the Chrysler took off well, but I suppose all those in need of the chop top look, with slab sides have already bought this car. Oh wait, the new Camaro has much the same properties. A V6 with a RWD is not going to be slow. Where did you get that notion from? The Ultimate Driving Machines are all RWD with those inline 6 engines. There are many benifits to RWD. There are some drawbacks too. If New Malibu is to be a FWD on the same platform, then what is the need for yet another car as the Aura? It is the very same car. And it is close to being say a Japan make car. Guess it is hard to explain, but I see a need for some NEW cars if GM is going to get an edge. I applaude Chrysler over the years for trying new ideas on designs. Of course they have to be practical at the same time. I think the new 300 and Charger have too smallish of windows, and perhaps a bit too much bulk look to satisfy enough customers. It did well, but now it may not in the end be well enough. Actually, shape wise, those previous 300M cars were hot looking to me. I little funny in the snout, but mostly a wonderful sporty line. Where is the sporty lines on the new stuff from GM, other than the Solstice and Sky?And there may come a day when ANY design without that chop top and high belt line, flat sided car would be welcomed. My goodness, even the old Nova would be more easy to live with. Nowadays one may dislocate an arm simply trying to hand an elbow out the window. And who loves this claustrophobic feel anyway. Raise the roof and lower the doors, please!As for how many people prefer the RWD to FWD, it is hard to say. I do think the knowledge about driving, the love of driving and cars, seems to be on the wane. Perhaps a plain old boxy SUV is more than enough style, and FWD vs RWD means nothing. Many can not drive RWD vehicles, which would explain many roll over accidents in my area. These are said to be rare, yet in my area I can listen to the scanner or read off the Net all the accidents as they occur in my CHP area. A LOT of roll over accidents. And on those rare days of rain, a lot of accidents. Maybe to nanny the new generation of drivers, they do need to say with FWD or should I say make more cars FWD or put all the electronic devices on all those RWD cars to keep them upright.

As I stated earlier, it won't happen because Chevy does not need a RWD Midsize family car for the ""masses"" in it's lineup...it needs a FWD family sedan like everyone else is offering. What if Chevy were to produce the particular vehicle that you speak of in VOLUME and it just happened to be a poor seller?GM ends up back at Square One.In a perfect world, perhaps we'd still have RWD Nova's, BelAir's etc...but the world ain't perfect. And by way of sales, it seems pretty clear that in the midsize sedan world, the majority prefer FWD, especially up north where the notion is that FWD and AWD are better for wintry traction (Whether true or not)GM simply cannot afford to take big risks with the Malibu. The Impala is diffentl the 300/Magnum/Charger revived a market that saw a need for RWD Big family sedans. Yet after all this time, no company so far has offerd a midsize RWD family sedan in this country? Why? Probably because the perception of the Accord and Camry have pushed people away from that idea. Many of today's buyers have a lack of trust for GM's products, what makes you think buidling a RWD Sporty Nova would make them more inclined to buy it over say the FWD, already established Chevy Malibu? Sure GM would be the only car in that market, but let's face it, GM hasn't built up enough new recognition to be reviving market segments (exception the Camaro) I don't see it happening. You want a RWD family sedan? Go to Aussie or wait on the G8 or next G6.And as far as the Malibu hurting G6 and Aura sales, the G6 should be up for redesign a year or so after the Malibu is released, making it RWD (since all Pontiacs will be) and the Aura is hurting mainly because GM didn't have the guts to give the car a 4 cylinder engine and allow it to be the true Opel that it should have been. The Aura is obviously ""competive"" seeing as it has beaten the Camry in two comparison tests and came close behind the Altima in one as wellThe Malibu will be that much better.GM can have two capable FWD midsize sedans (maybe a third one in the LaCrosse) if they design and market them right. One can be mainstream, one Euro-sporty and one Ultra-Luxury.And for what it's worth few ""Uniquely styled"" cars are sold in high numbers to the masses...exception Civic. Flops include the Maxima, Quest, Aztec, etc. etc.Saab shouldn't team up with anybody, the cars should stick to their fundalmental quirky roots and stay true to their heritage. Plain and simple.Bottomline..the FWD Malibu ain't going nowhere...but it would be a much better car if GM would outfit it with optional bluetooth, navigation, dual-zone climate control and more options.

What is so great about RWD anyway?advantages with some disadvatages - the 2 main advantages have to do with vehicle weight distribution which can get close to 50-50 on a well thought out (see BMW) RWD sedan (the reason why none of the cars in this group can ever be a true sports sedan is because 60% (or more) of the weight is over the front wheels), the elimination of torque steer (the inevitable consequence of alot of torque channeled thru the same wheels that are doing the steering). On the other side of the coin is the benefits (traction) of having that extra wieght over the drive wheels in a FWD car, and generally better FE simply becsuse FWD cars tend to weigh less overall. It has been so long that RWD sedans have been available to us in the 'mass market' classes that I really think that the consumer would have a tough time readjusting to them particulary those drivers that do have to drive on bad roads. Can you say 'sandbags in the trunk'? And, since FE is becoming such an influence on buying decisions these days, I can't imagine the FWD is going anywhere despite the better natural balance (and corresponding handling benefits) of RWD, although in those areas that aren't afflicted too much with snow covered roads (most of the country) buying a RWD car, if available, seems like a good decision to me.IMO, Detroit's future is in 'traditional' V8/RWD layouts much like the 300C and gas prices will largely determine how successful they are. Also IMO, Ford/GM/Chrysler's inabilities to build truly competitive and efficient smaller engines (going all the way back to the 'K' cars and the GM 'X' cars) will doom them to second tier status in this particular vehicle type if for no other reason than FE (with power) sells.

V6s are safer than I4s. I seriously doubt it. Perhaps you are thinking about safety in a passive sense, things like #of airbags, crash test results, electronic safety 'control' systems etc. AS OPPOSED to safety in an active sense - the ability of any car to avoid difficult situations. That extra HP let's say to pass that semi on a 2 lane highway comfortably or merging onto an interstate off a short on ramp. In short there is more to a safe car than how well it crashes or how much a computer will alow you to do before IT takes 'control'., and those 'active' safety features (things that the driver does control) and the resources with which he/she has to work with I am talking about. Those things that can help you avoid an accident(acceleration, braking, and handling) are what in my mind make a truly 'safe' car. If we are going to accept the contention that the Mazda6 is the best handling car of this group than it is also likely the safest car in this group - at least in that regard. And conversely if we know that the Fusion V6 (or 4) is the least powerful, it therefore must be considered the least safe in that regard as well. I am not labelling the 4 cylinder versions of these cars necessarily unsafe, heaven knows that even that 4 banger Fusion is much much safer in almost all respects than even cars made a short 10-15 years ago or so - the early to mid 90s - some really bad examples of 'wheezmobiles' - and we certainly all lived through it, didn't we?

I guess by that measure, those 500 hp luxury sedans that can go 0-60 in under 5 seconds are really safe.Let's get real. The powerful I4s in today's mid-sized cars--more powerful in some cases than the V8s of not long ago-- have more than enough power for safe driving. OTOH, the power waiting in those V6s can be an enticement to drive faster, for less safety for the driver and those around him/her. "

Captain2,You hypothesized that the Mazda6 might be the best-handling mid-size car and that the Fusion, both the V6 and I4, having the least powerful engine, might therefore be the least safe in the mid-size segment.That logic totally ignores the fact that Mazdas and Fusions have exactly the same engines and the Fusions (Milans, MKZs) are based on a slightly modified Mazda chassis.When it comes to safety, it is helpful to examine some raw data. From the Internet:Nationally, in 2005, there were 43,443 fatalities. Of these, 25,347 were a result of road departure, 9,188 intersection-related, and 4,881 were pedestrians.Does a more powerful engine prevent a driver from running off of the road? I doubt it.Will a powerful engine (who decides the definition of powerful?) help a driver get out of a tight bind? Sure, sometimes. But avoiding the bind in the first place is a better remedy. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.Our 221-horsepower 3.0-liter V6 Ford engine is quite adequate for our AWD Fusion, thank you. At no time during our seven months of ownership have I said to myself, ""Gee, I wish this car had 270 horsepower.""As a safety matter, I just don't see horsepower to be a significant factor. I once totaled a 1958 VW Beetle (32 horsepower). But the reason was driver error: I fell asleep at the wheel and took out a guardrail. "

That logic totally ignores the fact that Mazdas and Fusions have exactly the same engines and the Fusions (Milans, MKZs) are based on a slightly modified Mazda chassis. urnws- I think you are missing my point. In the sentences before I am contending that vehicle dynamics (power, handling, braking) are largely what makes a car safe and given that contention that a beeter handling car (the 6 in this case) is a safer car than the others in this group simply by accepting the generally held view that the 6 handles better. And likewise, if any car is down on power (like the Fusion (or the 6), for example) the opposite must also be true. Of your quoted 25347 road departure accidents, would be willing to bet that many of those were just like the one you had in your VW, not necessarily falling asleep at the wheel but probably inattention, cell phones, and/or 'playing' with the stereo - all the kind of things that are very unrelated to the task and responsibilities at hand. I never said anything like that 221hp (or even the 150-175hp in the 4 bangers) wasn't enough in any particular car (although you can go back in any number of my posts and find a number of times that I have said it just isn't competitive these days) - HP and relative FE numbers don't lie. What I did say though, is that I think the 270 is safer than the 221, not because it is anything that any of us that have it use even occassionally, but because it is there, in reserve, on those very rare occassions that we HAVE to use it - having that extra 50hp gives you the option of 'aggressively' (bad choice of words, perhaps) avoid a number of real life traffic situations similar to those I specifically mentioned. Not a whole lot different than having a car with a great set of brakes, the same sort of very rare times that a 10 or 15 feet shorter stopping distance can make a helluva difference. When was the last time that any of us can remember 'locking them up' (or getting the the ABS to engage)? If anybody out there can honestly answer 'it happens even semi-regularly' - well, then they are driving too 'aggressively' (good choice of words), their ABS is malfunctioning, and their insurance rates are justifably stratospheric.

Sorry. I love having more power from a V6 than a 4-cylinder, but a V6 being ""safer"" due to it's power reserve is simply ludicrous! For all the power ""in reserve"" that a V6 has, a 4-cylinder car, in general, handles better than a nose-heavy V6, due to it's lower front-end weight and better weight distribution. Great acceleration can help you avoid an accident, but so can an emergency lane change.Do I think a 4-cylinder model is safer than a similar V6 model? No way. Having both passive and active elements help to avoid/survive an accident, as well as defensive driving, paying FULL attention to the road ahead, around, and behind you, driving appropriately for road and weather conditions, and properly maintaining your vehicle.

a 4-cylinder car, in general, handles better than a nose-heavy V6absolutely - and therefore are 'safer' -in that respect, than the V6 - and effectively a tradeoff from a safety perspective - what you gain in handling abilities vs. what you are sacrificing in power.a true story - recently 'stuck' behind a little Korean subcompact, both of us attempting to merge off a short entrance ramp onto a busy highway that happens to be move at about 75 all the time. By the time he actually got to the end of the on ramp, he was huffing and puffing all the way up to maybe 45 or 50! The ensuing screeching of 'locked up' brakes and 'panic' lane changes , of course followed as he then 'forced' his merge, all from those 75 mph 'victims' of this certainly underpowered car cutting in front of them. Me, being relatively far behind him (maybe 100 yds.), understanding what he was attempting to do (and what he was attempting to do it in), and anticipating his probable inability to do it, bailed to the road shoulder but I thought I was about to be 'taken out'. What would expect this guy to do? Stop at the end of the ramp! That may be even worse than what he actually did do. And then you tell me, that having some extra power is ludricious and not safety related? Now that would be ludricruous! Granted an extreme example and I'll even admit that even a 4 banger from this particular group could at least approach a condition safe merging speed. BTW, I drive this ramp every day and left to my own means (and my own 268hp) I can easily hit that 75mph to merge. The Avalon, I drive, a safer car if only because of that 'surplus' of HP! Or maybe we should all drive around in (90hp?) Kias and then blame situations like this on the fact that many drivers largely ignore speed limits or tend to drive at speeds that 'keep up with the flow'? Oops can't do that either, give it enough time and even those Kias can (and do) move well above posted speeds as well! "

For those of you who think buying a Fusion is a bad bet because Ford is going out of business, you might want to take note: Ford just announced a 2nd quarter profit of $258M NOT including the proceeds from the sale of Aston Martin. That's right - profit, not loss. Revenue was up 6% from last year. And they did it while cutting rental fleet sales. And that doesn't really include the new Taurus/Sable or Focus sales and only a few Escape sales which are setting a record pace.It's amazing what can happen when you cut unnecessary costs, build high quality desirable vehicles at sustainable volumes.

a lot of times people merge too slowly onto a fast moving freeway thereby causing a traffic jam/slowdown/chain reaction of problems not only because their vehicle is underpowered, but mainly because they are idiotic, crazy, uninformed, and stubbborn. They simply refuse to waste the little bit of extra gas useage in order to accelerate at a reasonable rate so that they can merge safely. They are either too cheap or too dumb and instead choose to merge onto a 75-85 MPH flow of traffic at 45 MPH!!!! They choose saving a few drops of gas over safety and probably cause another 1,000 drivers 1000X more gas wastage due to traffic jams than they would have wasted themselves. Anyway, enough of my rant. If you have a 300 HP car then you should be able to merge at full speed even at 1/4 throttle. If you have 200 HP then you should be able to merge at full speed even on a short ramp at 1/2 throttle acceleration.If you have 100 HP then floor the damn thing! That will help!  "

I drive a 130 hp 1996 Accord with an automatic to work everyday. On my way home is a moderately long but steep uphill onramp onto I-65. Traffic generally flows around 70 MPH. If I accelerated modestly (making the 4-speed auto shift at around 3,200 RPM, say) I would barely be at 50-55 MPH by the end of the ramp. Instead, I use more of the car's available power (130 hp comes at 5200 RPM), wind up to just above 4,000 RPM, and manage to be going at least 65 MPH when my chance to merge comes in). "

It took just over 10 seconds, and that's with ~150k miles on the clock.On the other hand, my 2006 Accord (5AT, 166 hp) does the same between 8 and 9 seconds).*By the way, I never brake-torque the engine (it seems really bad for it).

Most of the V6 family sedans are ""above aberage"" in terms of acceleration, and most of the I4's are ""average."" I don't think that makes the V6's safer, however. Once you get quicker than average, in the hands of most drivers, the car becomes less safe. I for one know that I would be a less safe driver behind the wheel of a faster car. It's that tendency to think you can beat that semi while merging instead of just dropping in behind and then passing safely.This was proven for me when I was shopping for cars, in the insurance quotes I received. I looked at both the regular and the MazdaSpeed Mazda6. As far as insurance is concerned, replacement parts and crashworthiness should have been about the same, right? However, the faster car (the MazdaSpeed) would have been much more to insure (overall, ""less safe"" in the eyes of the insurance company). "
3612,"July 27, 2007 11:27AM","

More power can be more or less safe. It all depends on the driver. As far as insurance being more on higher performance cars, that usually applies more to ""sports cars"" because insurance companies assume these cars will be driven faster. The higher cost of the Speed6 over the regular 6 could be more about the higher cost of replacing the car (doesn't the Speed6 cost more), than it being less safe. "

Andres, your ignorance is glaring.In addition to all the driver demographics, vehicle demographics are taken into consideration. (At least they are in CT where I am an insurance agent.) Things like frequency of involvement in claims (accidents or theft/vandalism), damagability (the cost of vehicle repairs for standardized damage tests), and value of vehicle are factored into the rate. In CT, and I think most or all of the country, performance car ratings (high perf, intermediate perf or sport car) were dropped several years ago in favor of a more accurate measure of risk based upon actual make/model loss experience. (This evolution was probably helped when Caddy brought out the Northstar. Suddenly, Grandma was driving a ""high performance"" car and after time the statistics showed that Granny driving her Caddy had a better record than many others cars.) The words ""sport"" or ""speed"" have nothing to do with it. A Grand Cherokee Loredo Sport does not cost more to insure than a Grand Cherokee Limited. They're not in the class being discussed, they were just the first two examples that came to mind of the ""same"" vehicle with different sub-names not being rated differently due to a name.Another example was the 1984 Chrysler Laser and its Dodge counter part. They were the exact same car, except for the name. After a year or so on the market, the Chrysler became less expensive to insure than the Dodge. The Dodge didn't become more expensive, the Chrysler became less expensive. Why? Try loss experience and what type of driver was attracted to each car. Another myth is that manual shift cars cost more to insure than cars with A/T. If anything, the manual shift MIGHT cost less to insure due to the car (generally) having a lower MSRP than the car with A/T.The statistics are based on hundreds of thousands or millions of cars over a period of time.

I leased a Speed6 GT the end of Feb. 2006 and really loved and enjoyed the car very much. It was a real kick and pleasure to drive and I felt separated me from 99% of everything else on the road. It had speed, good looks, and all sorts of std. equipment most other cars did not have - keyless entry and starting, auto up/down all 4 windows, hid headlights, easy close trumk, adjustable height of headlights etc. But then the problems began which made me feel unconfident in the ability of the car to get me where I was going or getting home. First, the fuel pump went in Feb of this year in the middle of the snow storm here in the east. My wife & I were on 95 going to MD from NJ and the pump crapped out leaving us stranded and in real jepordy. It took a week and a half to get it fixed, and 4 months more to have Mazda pay me back for the expenses incurred. I decided to get rid of it and get something that has a better track record of durability, so I turned to the Legacy GT sedan. I am now driving the Legacy for around a week and like it too (not as much as the speed6 yet). BTW, I bought out of the Mazda lease 6 months early when I traded for the Legacy and wound up around $1,000 on the upside for the tradein. As I said, I like the Legacy too, but it doesn't make me feel as good driving it as the speed6 did. Maybe because the speed6 was a 6 speed stick and the only 08 Legacy turbo I could get my hands on is an automatic. Also, the speed6 is a much more user friendly car, more storage and all gauges and information is viewable at one time, the Legacy has a computer info center on one led - only one screen at a time.If anyone has any questions about my experiences, feel free to ask me.Artour "

i agree, it is great for the buyer who intends to keep the car for 10 years. But since I lease Jeeps I could care less, I want to see lower payments than their current lease offers which are not as good as on my 04 Jeep. This is using all rebates, lease loyalty and affiliate discounts. Old Mike "

you make a number of good points - the way these 'extended warranties are structured can make them almost worthless to the average car buyer. Don't believe the GM/Hyundai warranties are transferrable and you better believe that those mfgrs. know how fast mileage is accumulated and how long the average buyer keeps a car. It is, by any definition, a marketing 'gimmick', IMO. Chrysler can 'warranty' its cars forever but it doesn't change their products, and Chrysler's long term (Cerebus) future - which is shaky. Our compadre, akirby, can rage on all he wants about Ford's first 'profitable' quarter in a long long time, but it is really insignificant to the billions and billions they have lost recently - and the billions and billions more they had to borrow just so they could close some more plants and put even more Americans out of work. GM, OTH, while they have shown the same sort of ability to lose as much money as possible, seems content to simply become the world's first Chinese 'American' manufacturer.Given 'Detroit's' generally dire financial straits, I think buyers of those particular brands are really more likely to chance a worthless warranty because the company no longer exists, then they are to actually need to use that warranty in the first place.

There are very few models not covered--high performance cars, the big Mercedes-sourced van, and (interestingly) diesels, plus some fleet vehicles. But almost every vehicle is covered. Also, most long powertrain warranties don't go past the original owner. It's an inducement for someone to buy a Chrysler, much like the Hyundai/Kia/Mitsubishi warranty (which also doesn't transfer to other owners). "

There are very few models not covered--high performance cars, the big Mercedes-sourced van, and (interestingly) diesels, plus some fleet vehicles.I think the diesel drivetrains already come with some type of extended warranty, and since they are used for some very high mile applications (2-300k/yr) that might be too much to ask. I think its cool that they would be willing to support a single owner for a 150-200k lifetime. If the warranty covers the transmission and basic engine mechanicals (like the oil pump, head gasket, etc, but not the water pump), I think that would make me feel more comfortable with a vehicle.I also think since most people lease the car anyway, the exposure for Chrysler is minimal, and they might actually be making a reliable product :P "

If you'd pay attention you'd see that Ford isn't just cost cutting their way to profit, they're making fundamental changes to how they do business including better products but it won't happen overnight. One profitable quarter is simply a good sign that they're on the right path. We'll know in 4 years when the clean sheet new products arrive.I bet if Honda or Toyota came out with a similar warranty it would be praised as evidence of superior quality. Neither position is accurate as warranty length has nothing to do with quality - it's just an insurance policy with a defined cost that has to be built into the product. Higher quality means less warranty cost but you can put a 10 yr warranty on anything if you have enough profit to pay for the repairs. "

Exactly. It's not much of a risk for Chrysler because many people lease cars for a short time, and the average time of ownership of a car is just a few years (one article about this warranty quoted someone at Chrysler as saying 3 years). But it does really stand out as something unique in the industry, and therefore is a smart step for Chrysler, which is desparate to attract buyers any way they can. Then they have to hope that the curious people who come in to drive a Sebring or Avenger like the car enough to buy or lease it.One little problem I see with this warranty program: when Hyundai did it eight years ago, they had a big problem with lack of confidence in the quality of their vehicles. A long warranty can help alleviate that concern. I don't think Chrysler's big problem is vehicle reliability, at least not powertrain reliability. I think it's that they need more competitive car designs, especially mid-sized cars (and small cars too). A long warranty won't help solve that problem, but maybe it will help them stay in the game better until they can improve their cars. "

Well there are a few oddballs like me that buy a car new and keep it forever. Had our first two new cars for 12 years each and our 3rd for 10 and counting. Plan to keep the latest ones just as long.Most people in both our families are the same way and I expect our kids will be so also, so for us it would be a factor. OTOH, from the mfr's perspective, if all you attract are the buyers who come in once every 12 years (like me) you will only sell them 1/4 as many cars as you would to the same number of people who trade every 3 years. :surprise: I would have liked to have had a warranty like this on my windstar to cover all the gaskets in their sieve (3.8L engine). And actually, now that I think of it, it was seals and gaskets that led to the demise of it's predecessor...a Plymouth minivan.I think this would have caused me to give additional consideration to Chyrsler products, but pretty sure even after that I would not have chosen the Sebring.

I tend to keep new cars in the family for a long time also, but I don't put many miles on in a year. That is why the long warranties from Hyundai et. al. appeal to me. However, the warranty is no good to me if I don't like the car. The warranty is a tie-breaker for me, if more than one car crosses the bar in every other respect. The Sebring and Avenger don't do that for me. But suppose it came down to, say, an Optima and a Milan, for about the same price. Then the Optima's longer warranty would be a plus. "

Camcords have the warranties that they have precisely and only  because that is all that is needed to sell them - some of the cars in this group don't get a second look without it - and it would be foolish (and bad business) for Toyota/Honda (and Nissan) to do such a thing when all three cars sell just fine and magically blow away the lesser competition in long term reliability studies anyway. In short, these extended warranties are more likely evidence of suspect quality (and reputation) not superior.The Camcords, specifically, have set the standard in this class for about 25 years now, and there is no evidence at this point that any of this has changed other than the competition seems, over a much shorter term, to be getting a bit better. It's about time - it is not like those other manufacturers didn't have plenty of time to see how it's done...These warranties are offered for several marketing type reasons, but 'superior quality' is NOT one of them. 'Superior quality' is something that is expected from models from particular mfgrs., and not something that any warranty of any length is ever going to imply/evidence/guarantee (or whatever), for 10 years or 10 minutes!From your statement you are trying to tell me that the Sebring, in this case, must be the best built car available, if we are to assume that this model is covered by this Chrysler warranty?

Yes, class leading and competitive are certainly different terms, but, it would be refreshing to see any Detriot mfgr. make something other than a truck that would cause the real Big 3 in this class to take notice.The Avalon, BTW, which I guess is what you diss, is anything but 'weak kneed' in the 'Touring' trim which I own, has further won outright every comparo it has ever been a part of (TMK), has the lowest COO in its class, the best power (except for the V8s, of course), the best FE, and is the highest rated sedan CR has ever tested (tied with an Acura).

Wonder why buying a high mileage foreign car is considered a wise decision? Seems to me like a costly repair bill would be lurking in the future. I would think the domestics would cost less to repair and be less expensive to insure. On the other hand, buying a used Kia or Hyundai seems like not so wise a move. Yeah, I would buy a used Japan make first. The Kia / Hyundai needs to be backed by the original owner warranty, thus bought new and held for ten years to pay out.My Dad knew a traveling salesman that bought high mileage Civic, drove them another 50K to 100K then dumped it and bought another one.

Reviewing my friends that have owned Chrysler products, all have had reasonable luck, even though most never adhered to a routine maintenance program, and that includes oil changes. I recently sold our 1994 Grand Caravan with the 3.3L V6 and 4-speed automatic that we purchased new in late 1994. After 170K miles, the engine was only using about a quarter of a quart of oil between changes (3K or 3 months), and it had the ORIGINAL 4-speed automatic, and it still shifted fine. I used Mobil 1 synthetic, and change ATF every 24k. During trips it would deliver 26MPG with a full load of family and luggage. Many purported economy cars today don't do too much better.I really believe that much of the poor reliability with any car relates to extremely poor preventive/routine maintenance by the owner.As to Chrysler's new Lifetime Power Train warranty - I believe it may be a tactic of the new private equity firm owner (Cerebus) to improve sales in the short term (3 to 5 years) to bolster the stock price, and then they will dump Chrysler at a decent profit. After all, that's what private equity firms generally do! "

they won't exist in 10 years anyway, so the warranty won't be worth the paper it's written on. as much as I might agree with you on the quality comments, and the forbodding 'purchase' by Cerebus might support this, remember that it was Chrysler that required all those loans on the last 'bail-out' several years back and it was the K car, the minivans, and the SUVs/trucks combined with some lower gas prices that allowed Chrysler to pay everything back with interest - early. It may be a little early to declare C, Ford, or GM dead. It would be generally devastating to this country if this would happen to any of the three, in any case.I've always thought that Chrysler had a penchant for one thing - styling - but also that their products were crappola otherwise. A Sebring (or 300) in my driveway, not a chance, warranties notwithstanding - more like I wouldn't want to have to deal with what I would anticipate being the aggravation of ever owning one - who is actually paying for those repairs being secondary!

Before that, the main cooling fan motor went at somewhere around 140k-150k miles (the actual mileage is escaping me at the moment). That was $350 or so. For a car worth $4,000 or less, I've spent $1,100+ not including brakes/tires/gas/oil changes/body repairs since I've had the car. Sure, some cars will cost you that before you hit 100,000 miles, but life isn't perfect on the north side of 150k either. To its credit, I have entirely original exhaust system, alternator, fuel pump, and transmission, things that often are shot by this point in a car's life.(By the way, I got the car in Aug. 2002, when it had 121,000 miles on it = 5 years and 53,000 miles under my ownership).

Those are all cheap repairs in my opinion. An expensive repair is one that costs more than $500. So your new radiator is borderline, and that happened at 172K miles. In my domestic it seemed almost every repair ended up leading to at least 2 issues to be repaired; which ended up always costing $400 or more (WITH MANY BEING $1,000 OR MORE) way back in the late nineties.

Sure, the engine will continue to run fine, but with so many miles on original parts, the odds of having to fix something are far to great for me.Now if the car is cheap enough, thats a different story.I'll give you an example. My 98 200sx with 147k miles and 9 years old has everything on it original. with the sole exception of the front brakes and the battery. that leaves the rear brakes, altenator, starter, power motors for the windows, and moon roof, distributor, water pump, radiator, clutch, exhaust...........i could continue, but you get the point.........with a lot of age and miles on them. I'm not expecting it to, but with so much original equipment that thing could easily turn into a repair nightmare (or mechanics dream depending on your POV :P ).

There's not much difference between 995 and 1004, but if the line is drawn at 1,000 there will be a difference. I just checked the ISO rating symbols and saw that a 2006 Audi A3 ""sport"" or ""premium"" have the same rating symbol--18. The question about trim is probably a standard question that must be answered in a computerized rating/quoting system and has nothing to due with the name a manufacturer slaps on a car for marketing purposes. Do you really think that a Dodge Caravan ""Sport"" is ""sporty?""Insurance companies have been working toward providing the most accurate quotes possible so there won't be any unpleasant surprizes at the time of purchase. To improve accuracy they need more detailed information than they needed a few years ago. Why does that make you ""annoyed, suspicious, and rightfully angry?"" Do you get angry about other questions they ask, some of which may lead to discounts? "

Well, I can't report 250K miles (which I think is excessive to expect even in this day of an easy 100K car) on our 2000 Elantra, an early enough model that apparently doesn't qualify as one of the ""greatly improved"" products Hyundai builds these days (built in the ""bad old days"" for Hyundai). But, its quality is good enough to have traveled 161.5K miles with only an alternator/battery replacement. Sure...tires, brake parts etc have been replaced. My son drives this car 100 miles per day and since he is in Chicago for a week I have been driving it.

So why do Insurance Companies use retarded things like ""ranges"" when they should be using ""ratios"" to be more exact and accurate.A 19,001 dollar car should not cost that much more to insure than a 18,999 dollar one (if they are otherwise virtually identical). To be honest, fair and ethical, shouldn't insurance companies stop using ranges like 12-15,000 miles, and start using mathematical ratios to figure out that the difference between 12,000 and 15,000 miles driven per year is significant, but the difference between 11,950 and 12,050 miles/year is less than 1%?

I remember reading a few months back that the Mazda6 was one of the least costly to insure compared to other cars in this class. Part of the reason, I would think, would have to do with the a relatively low cost to repair to the bumpers and the rest of the car compared to other cars in this class according to the study done by the insurance companies. And perhaps another part may be that better handling cars will have a better chance at avoiding an accident. Of course using this logic, a sports car would have very low insurance rates, which they don't, so maybe this theory shouldn't be emphasized too much, but I'm not sure what else would explain the differences... maybe the mazda6 looks so nice, other cars don't want to hit it? :shades: "

Price ranges are the starting point for physical damage insurance; the line has to be drawn somewhere, just like a city or state boundary line, or voting district boundary lines. Live on one side of the line and you're in a different category than w neighbor who lives on the other side of the line.After the price range starting point other factors are considered such as frequency of claims and damagability. It's not an everyday happen stance, but it's not unusual for a more expensive car, whether a couple bucks more expensive or even a few thousand bucks more, to have a lower rating symbol than a lower prices car. Regarding you annual mileage concern: I'm not familiar with that as none of the companies I represent use that criterion. But, again, for those companies that do, a line has to be drawn somewhere. The system is not individualized but is based on large numbers. If it were individualized and you had a somewhat serious accident, you might never be able to afford car insurance again and without insurance you might not be able to register a car or drive. "

On average, I'd say it's true. If you crash a Buick, and a Benz into a wall at 20mph, the Benz will likely cost more to repair, even if it has a little less damage.

It's all about the cost to repair. It costs less to buy, costs less to repair, and therefore costs less to insure. Makes sense huh?If only things were that simple as that kind of logic...actually, as bhmr59 mentioned, there is not a big correlation between the cost of a car vs the cost to repair a car. In the IIHS study that tested most of the midsize cars, the Sonata in a full frontal fender bender cost 4 times more to repair than the Mazda6! And the Altima cost nearly 3 times more in a rear fender bender in comparison to the Mazda6 (probably because the Altima has those huge faux crystals on the back that they call taillights). And the accord cost 3.5 times more to repair a front frender bender than the Mazda6. Of course deductables make these costs not as significant to the owner, but this would help to understand why the Mazda6 was found to be one of the least expensive to insure in the midsize class. The handling differences are not that great. Tell that to the girl in the passenger seat of a bmw that made a sudden left hand turn into my lane a couple weeks ago... going by the test results by many car mags, if I were driving an Accord or Altima, I would have not been able to stop in time and that girl would have a few reasons to be very unhappy.

In mixed suburban driving, 28-30 MPG is typical for me.It is also plenty quick, although I believe testing shows the Altima to be faster.Go drive them and form your own opinions. Accords can be had well below invoice at this point, and in-turn, may give you more bang for your buck.The best advice I can give is to drive as many vehicles as you can before making a decision. "

Based on the things you've said so far, you want something both fun and frugal with an automatic. It also sounds like you don't mind a slightly smaller car so long as it has 4 doors (which is why you'd consider the sentra). Some questions I would ask before making a recommendation would include...1 - would you like to be able to haul somewhat larger items without having to borrow a pickup or SUV? in other words, would a hatchback or wagon be desireable as long as it looked ok?2 - how much do you like to drive? do you like twisty roads or do you just want enough power to get past the slowpokes? or is a car just a way to get from a to b? 3 - how long do you think you'll keep the car? will the length of standard warranty be a factor for you?4 - if you could save money on the car purchase, would gas mileage be as important (think of the savings on buying the car as a gas allowance...)?or if you don't want to think that much, the Altima would be a good choice as long as you can get used to the funky transmission. the Accord is always a good, although a bit too common, choice. and of course the Mazda6 (yes I'm biased...that's what I have) will be fun to drive in the twisties and will have the option of the hatchback which looks like a sedan but can store/ haul big things. The 4 banger automatic is a bit slow though...but you can get it in some markets for 6k+ off of msrp. The Sonata would be another choice that could be described as ""practical"" and ""value oriented.""In the end though, grad is right...drive many of the cars, and don't make a decision too quickly. and never let a saleperson know that you really really like their car!!! always say it's nice, but so was the other car (insert name here). and don't drive a car that you can't afford or don't really want (like a 2 door coupe)... you may make a decision you would regret later. You'll find many opinions here, so if that's what you want, you've come to the right place! "

Elroy, you're on the right track, but the car that is less expensive to buy is not necessarily the less espensive to repair after an accident.My Mazda6 S was roughly $20 less to insure per year than our '96 Civic was. Go figure! The 6 did cost about $4000 more to buy too. That was with Allstate. We've since switched to State Farm and they are only charging me $40 more per year to insure a 2006 Mustang GT over the Mazda6 it replaced. The Mustang cost $9000 more than the 6 to buy(after rebates and all on the 6 which I factored into the difference from the Civic above too).The 6 was leased though so I'm not sure that that had anything to do with it.

None of these cars have ""above average"" fuel economy, and I wouldn't make the final decision over 1 mpg anyway. Have you considered the Camry hybrid?

You could probably make out like a bandit with a 2007 though. The Sentra is not as roomy as the Accord. How long do you want to keep the car?

going by the test results by many car mags, if I were driving an Accord or Altima, I would have not been able to stop in timeprobably a very difficult thing to know for sure simply because I doubt very seriously that you know how much distance exactly it took you to stop or even whether that distance was the best your particular car could do. Maybe I need some references here, but 60-0 tests I've read show the Mazda6/Fusion at a smidge over 130 feet (the longest stopping distances in this group), where the other cars you mention test at several feet LESS. In any case, I would suggest that any difference, better or worse, within let's say 10 feet or so is insignificant given the influences of driver reaction time, road and tire type and conditions etc. Kinda like a high speed accelerating swerve I pulled off awhile back - that has me sold on the benefits of the 'excessive' power I have and has further convinced me that I may not be here today if my car had happened to be ESC equipped - I have no way to KNOW that I couldn't have done the same thing sans the extra HP and with the stability control interference.

""I know the insurance knows why, but I sure don't, nor did I ask.""When I got the 1991 Mazda 626, the insurance company ran the VIN number and it came back as a two-door... and they wanted to charge a considerably higher rate just because it was showing up in their system as a coupe.There were very minor differences between the 4-door and the 2-door... same engine choices, transmissions, etc. They even used the same frame. One was not considerably larger, costlier, faster, or safer than the other. The single biggest difference between the two was the body style. Mazda just decided to call the 4-door the 626 and the 2-door the MX-6.We had to actually drive the car to the local insurance office so that they could see it in person to verify that it was, in fact, a sedan and not a coupe.

""...would you like to be able to haul somewhat larger items without having to borrow a pickup or SUV? in other words, would a hatchback or wagon be desireable as long as it looked ok?"" So far in the 6 months I've owned my Accord, I've had it filled to capacity several times, with anything from luggage and passengers, to bicycles and gear, to 10-foot peices of moulding (inside the car!), to old rotting lumber. I've never missed my previous SUV.However, I think you are onto something about the larger (midsize) hatchbacks like the Mazda6. Well, there aren't many others are there? I don't know why this isn't a more popular choice today. Standing and looking at my sedan, there is a lot of wasted space in the design of the cargo area, specifically the differences between a sedan and a hatchback. What is the value of having a fixed rear ""parcel shelf"" which basically just holds the rear speakers? All I can think of is traditional sedan styling, and perhaps the security of being able to lock items into a closed trunk.While I've been happy so far with the volume and variety of my cargo capacity, incorporating the back glass into a larger, roof-hinged trunk door and eliminating that ""parcel shelf"" would allow more room and much easier access. I'm sold on the hatchback idea if it is executed well like the Mazda6. "

Simply upgrading the brake pads can make a huge difference. My last ride was a 4,400-lb SUV with an appetite for pads and especially rotors. For the third replacement, out of warranty this time, I upgraded to a set of ceramic pads. After breaking them in a bit, I pointed the truck down a hill and stood suddenly on the brake pedal. The difference in braking power over the previous sets of stock pads was astounding to me. I don't have numbers, just seat-of-the-pants feel. When I showed my wife, she was amazed as well. My heavy truck had become one of the best-braking vehicles I've owned. When it's time for pads on my car, I'm going to look into an upgrade this time as well.Sure, they cost a bit more and probably won't last quite as long, but if you are concerned about stopping power, this is the way to go. Those ceramic pads also didn't produce nearly as much brake dust, and my mechanic said they are actually better on the rotors. "

None of these cars have ""above average"" fuel economy, and I wouldn't make the final decision over 1 mpg anyway.I agree.For these cars in 4 cylinder versions, 1 mpg saves about $400 in 100,000 miles. That would mean $40-80 per year for most people, based on 10,000-20,000 miles per year. I think in CR tests almost every 4 cyl is within maybe 2 mpg of every other. So in most cases you are talking about a difference of $80-160. For me this is not enough difference to have any significant impact on my car choice. Anyway, the differences in purchase price can be more than enough to make up for any mpg deficiency, in some cases. I believe I would have had to pay $3000-4000 more to buy an Altima or Accord, rather than my Mazda6. If fuel costs me $800 more over the first 100,000 miles, I am still way ahead. As always, the calculus is different for frequent traders. "

The Mazda6 seems to have an advantage in breaking in the comparison test done by Edmonds (I prefer to use comparison tests since the results are gathered from the same track on the same day which controls for weather differences).

and this may all be true, although it was MT that listed both the Fusion and 6 at 131 feet. As kdshapiro noted 'a sample size of 1' that probably makes no allowances for driver to driver differences as well. I guarantee you that I could get a car to stop in shorter distances when I was 20 years old, then I can now simply because I would imagine my reaction times have aged as much as I have. Nobody said that the 6 had 'bad' (or especially good) brakes, only that it is a stretch to assume that any car will avoid an accident when a different car wouldn't, when what we are really talking about about a lousy 10 feet or so of 'tested' braking distances - which BTW translates to 1/8 of a second of reaction time at 60 mph.. While a good set of brakes is probably #1 on my list of REAL (and useful) active safety features, it is still only a part of what makes a dynamically 'safer' car, those other parts being power and handling. The trick, of course, being able to avoid an accident so that you don't end up with 538 airbags giving you chemical burns.... "

It stopped hard and fast and did save my butt a couple of times. Once from an idiot and once from a deer on a highway. Both were panic stops where the brake pedal went as far as I could push it and the ABS didn't even have to kick on either time.

you miss the point - your 4 feet, if indeed that is the case, is inconsequential - a Camcordima driver can properly say that his brakes 'saved his butt' quite correctly, that is what brakes are for! I would further suggest that if you don't get your ABS to kick in on what you regard as a 'panic' stop then either the ABS isn't working right or it wasn't really a 'panic' stop at all! If the 6 has a higher level of wheellock tolerance in its ABS settings, that would likely serve to reduce braking distances simply because of that and be (somewhat) unrelated to brake system effectiveness.

I would wager that those same summer tires (technically they were all-season OEMs but that was a joke) increased my stopping distance in the winter. However, being that it was a stick I used engine braking a lot during those months.I know for sure that the ABS did not come on when the car pulled out in front of me but it might have come on for the deer. It was dark and cold and my family was in the car so a lot of other things went through my mind and the ABS could have slipped my mind.

Not hauling anything but maybe 3 kids and wife. Mostly doing city driving. I just like the thought of having both power and saving on gas. So far, it seems to me, to have power you have to give up on high mpgs or visa versa. I intend to buy within a year. Thinking of buying slightly used and would keep it for 5 to 10 years. Being that the case, even one mpg difference might mean a lot one day soon. Definitely want something with 4 cyls. Camry hybrid is out of my price range. The Sentra's size is just enough for my needs, but don't want smaller than that. No other small sedan with an A/T that size has 177 Hp, uses regular fuel, and has a new government mpg rating as high as 24 city/ 30 highway. My other car is 06 V6 Rav4 with 3rd row. Mother-in-law just bought the 07 V6 Camry. Took it for a spin. Great ride!I was impressed by the 07 Altima because it showed better performance with improved fuel economy, even if it's only a 1 or 2 mpg difference, you have to admit, it's still impressive. According to Consumer Reports, the 4 cyl Accord 0-60 was 9.0 seconds, the Altima's 8.1, V6 Rav4 0-60 in 6.7 (same engine in the Camry).

Unless you've got a serious itch, I'd wait just a little longer.One other thing...if you're going to have a driving style where your 0-60 times are important to you (in other words gunning it when you have a chance), you can pretty much ignore the EPA estimates cuz you'll probably end up getting much less than that. Since you liked the Camry, it sounds like you like a soft-ish ride. I've heard the Altima is on the firmer side so make sure that this is ok for you on the type of roads you'll be driving on. "

MPG for an 07 I4 automatic Accord is 24, not 20. It is 20 for the 6 cylinder which is much faster in the 0-60. A 4 cylinder Accord is def better on gas than a 6 cyl Altima. "

Believe what you want but I'd wager that all Mazda6 owners who participate here will back me up on the great brakes that car has. I never said it didn't did I? - if you want to consider a few feet of stopping distance the difference between 'great' (there are a number of primarily European cars that can get into the 110s 60-0) and merely 'good' then all the more power to you - keeping in mind of course that your 4 feet translates into about 1/20 of a second in time reduction it supposedly takes you to stop (from 60) as opposed to the other cars in this group. You do point out a real difference maker in both handling and braking prowess, however, those summer tires you are talking about. Or you could go even further and put in a good set of 'softer' ceramic pads, cross drill some rotors, and maybe rival those BMWs in brake performance. Brake performance has a lot to do with fade resistance and ease of modulation and much less to do with somewhat subjective tested stopping distances, which will vary from car-to-car (and driver-to-driver) in any case.

if you want to consider a few feet of stopping distance the difference between 'great' I never compared the brakes of the 6 to the other car's brakes because I haven't driven any of them recently. So I'm not sure why you keep asking me to validate which brakes are good and which are great. You also keep comparing test results like they are some kind of fact and a 6 will always stop 4 feet shorter than an Accord, or whatever else, just because the tests show that. Unless two vehicles are tested on the same day at the same location then the numbers need more information attached to them. C&D now publishes weather data in their test results now, which helps decipher the performance data, but I couldn't find any for any of these cars. Environmental factors can vary results such as stopping distance by several feet. You can start getting into the measurements that equal lengths of cars when that happens and that IS significant. "

They are not designed for cold temperatures, and will become very brittle and hard and not grip the snow and ice. That is why 'summer tire' cars require dedicated snows in winter in cold climates, or switch to all seasons.If you use an all season ultra-high treadwear rating tire, you are already used to that since it is hard and doesn't grip particularly well all year round :P Its interesting as ""traction"" is stamped on the tire with a letter grade, but what it really represents is wet weather braking. It has nothing to do with how well a tire can start on something slippery or how well it corners, just wet braking. Whats more is like all the information printed on the tire, it is tested by the tire manufacturer, not any independent organization (at least for FE, the EPA does the testing). "

I agree with what you said captain a few posts ago when you were saying that brakes are one of the most significant safety features a car can have. This was definitely illustrated to me quite clearly when that idiot driver in the bmw made a very unsafe left hand turn into my lane when I was going about 50 mph... had I been driving the Accord, the data from Edmunds comparison test of midsize sedans indicate the girl in the passenger seat would likely have been hurt. Given that I stopped within a foot from the front passenger door of the bmw while I was in my Mazda6, the 10 extra feet that the Accord took or the 14 extra feet the Altima took to stop in that comparison test, that extra distance could have led to a very bad accident. I don't know why you keep talking about reaction times...my reaction times are the same if I'm driving an Accord or Mazda6, so the distance it would take me to stop would be higher in the Accord than the Mazda according to the car magazines that tested both cars on the same day on the same track with the same driver. Perhaps you're right about some cars slowing down my reaction time... the average midsize sedan would be a bit soft and boring to me and my senses might be dulled as a result and leaving my a bit sleepy and bored, thus a bit slower. Another argument for engaging cars like the Mazda6!!! "

In my track experience, the Contour with stock brakes and stock tires seemed balanced, but when I started using the R-compound track tires (that happened to be 20mm wider also), the brakes started to get in over their head. I upgraded the pads and rotors front and rear, added stainless steel flex lines (they are usually rubber) and used a better brake fluid, and the braking improved considerably (more the fade resistance than anything). On street tires, I could invoke ABS at freeway speeds in a panic stop.I don't know what I am going to do with the Accord yet, since Honda put an oddball tire size on the the '07 EX, making upgrades more challenging with a 16"" wheel.

Yeah, I'd have to agree the Michelins on my Mazda6 are a bit of a weak point. I have heard from many Mazda6 owners who have changed tires to other brands that cornering, braking, and wet weather handling improves considerably.

I do plan on upgrading to lighter wheels and better gripping tires in the near future and I can't wait to see the improvements in handling and braking. "

and this may all be true, although it was MT that listed both the Fusion and 6 at 131 feet.the following is quoted from motortrend in a midsize comparo (note the mazda6's lack of significant brake fade after repeated 60-0 stops):""We all agree the 6 has the most well-balanced, confidence-inspiring chassis--especially for navigating the canyons--of our group. It neither understeers nor oversteers when pushed to the limit, and its tires never scream ""mercy!"" While it may lack the brutish punch of the Altima, it more than makes up for it with quick reflexes and sure-footedness. Everything works together in harmony: the supportive seats, good driving position, broad gear ratios, quick steering, and unfailing brakes.We had a suspicion the Mazda 6 would be up to the task at the test track--and it was. The V-6 Mazda ran a 6.67-second 0-60 time with only a mild case of front-wheel hop. We just barely noticed the variable-valve timing and negligible torque steer kicking in somewhere in the upper-rev range when the quarter mile flew past in 15.13 seconds at over 94 mph. Standing on the brake pedal at 60 mph produced an impressively short 121-foot stop that grew only slightly after the fourth or fifth attempt. In the 600-foot slalom, a 63.9-mph pass puts it at the top of this test, as well as near the top of the sedan segment."" "

Fit and finish and materials are terrific.Then there's that aluminum 235-horse, 3.3-liter V-6, which is as quiet at 70 mph and at wide-open throttle as a BMW 335i's and is way, way quieter at idle. It performs other BMW-ish feats, too, such as pulling the Sonata all the way to 144 mph, or, if you're caught on photo radar in Scottsdale, 147 mph... .

1) it is a good car, though others are better. If you take it for a test spin and look over the interior closely, I think most people would say, pretty good, as in 80% or 85% that of an Accord or Aura. It simply doesn't have the steering and overall refinement of the best. It is fine for the money, if you keep it though the warranty period.2) Other cars will go pretty darn fast without a speed limiter. As for the 147 MPH, I guess it is all things possible, but I am not so sure that is accurate.

Original MSRP was just under $26k. Don't know what your price was, but it's lost about $10k in value. I don't think bhmr59's Sonata has lost $10k in value yet, and if it's worth less than your car right now, consider that he paid far less than you did for your car.

Remember, we are talking about '07, or earlier, cars. Early this year, I did not care about what Honda may offer for '08. My '03 Accord LX V6 had ABS, Traction Control (TCS), Electronic Brake Distribution, and front curtain air bags. It also had 240HP with 30 highway miles per gallon, something the Sonata has struggled to duplicate either. "

You got a car listed as $21,445 for 16,651 = Wow! Good price. Not a bad deal, even if the car is 80 to 85% compared to the others. Not a bad deal. They are selling about half their cars to rental fleet and now giving away the rest. This doesn't bode well for the future. There is no way I can argue though that if you keep the car for a long time, the deal was not a good one. You made a deal! As for performance, it all depends on how you drive a car. Most people will see little difference between most of the makes on the road. Loren "

I don't know if I'd say that the Sonata is a generation behind the Accord...I drove the Sonata over a few days and came away much more impressed with it than I thought I would. It was quiet, smooth, had plenty of power, and ergonomic (besides the driver seat which was cutting circulation off in my right hamstring unless I tipped the front seat so far forward I was sliding out). And I have seen the pics of the redone center stack in the Sonata and it is much much better than before. I did like the Accord better overall in the interior design and having a slightly firmer suspension (I happen to prefer this) while having a lot less body lean in corners. But it'd be hard for me to pay 4 or 5k more for the accord when the Sonata would be perfectly acceptable especially when considering Consumer Reports and JD Powers rate most of these midsize cars almost identically (on a percentage basis) for reliability over a five year period. Once again, the Accord lovers in this forum want to make a mountain out of a mole hill and say that the Accord is in a ""different league"" or that we ""fool ourselves"" into thinking another car is comparable when really the differences are not that significant. Just a snobbish attitude if you ask me...they are both good cars and are worthy of consideration in this category. "

A Honda SE V6 has stability control, traction control, electronic brake force, all those air bags, a 6 CD changer, and all that jazz. The difference is in the car. The Honda is faster, and handles better, and has better steering feedback / feel. The interior is of better quality. Don't know about Edmund's resale values as quoted here are for, but overall, going by Kelly Book, Honda Accord has always been near the top for resale value. Sonata is going to have to be so much lower. You can not run half your sale via fleet and run huge discounts without running the resale values down -- sorry but that's life.I fully understand how the Sonata can work as a cost saving car, if bought and held for a decade. From an economics point of view, in this case scenario, fine - good enough choice. And if you love or really like some element of Sonata or Hyundai over the rest, then fine too, to each his own, and it is right for you. Ultimately what is right for the person opening up the wallet, is the correct car for that individual.Everyone has different priorities.Loren "

Accord SE comes with those Michelin tires which cost $210 or so at Costco, unless they are running that $60 off, or whatever it is at the time. This makes the tires say perhaps $250 retail each = ouch! Come the time, if I still own the car, I am thinking Kumho tires. Some of those are rated excellent for performance, with I am sure less tread life. But the cost, of the better Kumho tires for the car is around half that of the Michelin, as per TireRack research. Yokohamas may be good too. Of course the Michelin tires could last 50K miles, if I slowed for corners. They put the tire pressure at 32 after the oil change. I am thinking 34 may be best. A little scuffing on those edges, do I see!As for speed, was it 2007 model of the Sonata which did not have any speed limiter? I think they do now for 2008.

If that is what Sonatas are selling for they are priced right. Most buyers are willing to pay a premium for a Honda or a Toyota. They will not pay a premium for a Chevy or Hyundai. Basically, a Hyundai, and a Chevy for that matter, has to be priced quite a bit cheaper than a Honda. Haven't driven a Sonota, although I did sit in one (a rental), terrible seat, but I drove a Santa Fe which was nice. The dealer said I can have whatever Santa Fe I wanted at invoice. Sounds like the Sonatas are discounted more. I had an uncle shop for an elantra a few years ago and the dealer would deal at all. That turned him off real quick. "

For those who feel, and rightly so the majority of the time, that Hyundai resale values are dismal, consider this example. My neighbor bought a 2006 Hyundai Elantra GLS Automatic 4-door sedan (Yes, I know this forum is for Midesize sedans, but thought this would be informative for the readers) for his wife in February 2006, and paid $13,500, including sales tax (6.5%), title, and license/registration. The original sticker MSRP was $15,220, so he got a very decent deal on the purchase.Although his wife initially loved the car, she realized some time later that she wanted something a bit larger for carrying all of her friends to luncheons, etc. During its tenure in their family, she had absolutely no problems with it, it was in perfect ""as new"" condition, and it had only 9,400 miles on the odometer. To make a long story short, he just sold it (privately) for her through a listing in the local newspaper's classifieds - the selling price: $12,500. A year and a half of ownership for $1,000 - not bad in my opinion. Of course, it helped that the buyer was looking for a pristine 2006, and not the current generation. "

Ok, I'll give it to you the way I see it (you may see things differently). Many other midsize cars were introduced at least 3 years after the Accord. Yet the Accord wins MOST comparison tests (CR, C&D, among others) competing against these recently redesigned cars. The current Accord has been around since 03. The Sonata 06, Fusion 06, Camry 07, Altima 07, Aura 07. The Altima is the only car that is close, and it took Nissan 4 years to do it. And who's to say the next generation of these other cars will be able to best the current Accord. Well, that's my opinion (of course opinions are like mileage, and will vary widely).

There has been some rumors flying around the new Mazda6 and it looks like one of the rumors has turned out to be true. Some have been suggesting that Mazda was going to take Ford's 3.5 and work their magic on it. The CX-9 will be the first (and hopefully not the last) to get the new 3.7 liter that has 10 more hp (from 263 to 273) and a big bump in torque (from 249 to 270). Of course it's still too early to know if the Mazda6 will be getting this same engine, but it would be quite a development if it did. And if AWD gets added to the list of options for this car, that could make a huge leap in performance to a car that already performs quite well.  "

 It would be fantastic if Mazda keeps their V6 pricing levels about the same, you know more in line with the Fusion and Sonata V6s, than with Accord, Camry and Altima V6s. Then they would really have a winning formula.I am afraid, however, that they will increase prices significantly with the new model as it is supposed to be larger, more powerful, etc. I hope they don't price themselves out of the market as they have been known to do lately. Witness the huge rebates/discounts and/or slower than expected sales on Mazdaspeed6 and RX-8. IMHO, both of those cars were priced too high to begin with.Currently, Mazda6 V6s are moving in the low 20's right? This is a couple grand less than Japanese competitors. When the new model comes out, are you going to be able to find a Mazda6 V6 in the low 20's? If they price themselves the same as Accord and Altima, IMO they will continue to have sales troubles. "

I hope the new Mazda6 is so good that they can charge as much as the Accord and Altima... thing is, most of the cars in this segment are really good and to expect or hope that any new car will leave others in the dust is unrealistic. and to get people to think of the Mazda6 beyond zoom-zoom or as a niche product will take a huge and successful marketing effort which they have not shown themselves to be capable of. So although when the car is first released and assuming it gets some good press it will likely sell much nearer to MSRP than now, when the honeymoon is over, I'm sure a price advantage will have to be part of Mazda's strategy for it to be more successful than the current Mazda6.

I have been following the forum for quite a while now. In January 07, my wife and I purchased a midnight blue Aura XR with the moroccan brown leather. Beautiful car. I know the Camry and Accord are the top sellers, but I truly think most people are missing out by not considering the Aura. The 3.6 with the 6 speed automatic is a gem. Just returned to San Diego from Las Vegas. The car was made for that trip. Tankfuls were 27 mpg, 26mpg, 28 mpg and 27 mpg. Climate control at 73 degrees. We have just over 3500 miles on the car.I was curious before the trip to see how it would pull the grades. Most hills no downshift at all. On the long grade before Baker, one downshift into 5th and 80 mph at 2500 rpm.The car is extremely quiet. The gearing certainly encourages highspeed running, 80 mph in 6th is 21-2200 rpm.One thing we have learned is that the transmission takes about 1000 miles to truly learn your driving style. The transmission learns over that time. After 1000 miles, it seems to never make a misstep. Add 5star crash testing all around, plus my wife loves the adjustable pedals and you have one great car. Originally I was concerned that 252 horsepower would not be enough with Camrys with 268 and Altimas with 270, but believe me, I never thought I would say this, 252 is more than enough.Unlike the Camry, it doesn't float. I have a 2006 Impala LS I drive for work, great car, but the Aura is in another league for curves. Steering feel is so much better in the Aura. It just does everything well. "

Most average cars don't hold up well in high speed crashes. These pictures were taken after a wreck which occurred less than 5 miles from my house in December 2006. I didn't take them, they are posted on the local news channel website. The car shown, a Honda Accord, was stopped at a light when it was hit from behind by a Nissan Pathfinder which was estimated to be traveling at around 60 mph. Witnesses say they heard the big engine revving up at full throttle moments before the impact... The driver of the Pathfinder was fine, but the Accord's occupants did not make it, as well as a motorcyclist. Very sad, and scary. "

No, you are not slamming the Sonata. But you used a four-letter word that starts with ""sh"" to describe it. You meant it as a compliment then, as in ""oh sh**, what a nice car!""?The Sonata is not the equal to the Legacy in one important aspect: Legacy has standard AWD. In some other aspects, the Sonata is superior to the Legacy. As for being equal to the Accord, the Sonata is superior in some ways and not as good in others. So ""better"" is relative to what the buyer is looking for. If someone is looking for a mid-sized car with lots of room, strong performance, excellent safety features, and would like to spend as little as possible for it, the Sonata might be ""better"" in that buyer's eyes than the Accord. The Accord might be better for someone looking for, for example, crisper handling. "

As a car IMO, the Accord is better in the absolute sense. But you are right in the way you refer to buyers priorities. Using your baseline, a Lincoln Town car can be a better than vehicle for some buyers than a 750i if one is looking for a roomy luxo sedan at a much cheaper price. In the absolute sense though I would take the 750 over the Town Car in a heartbeat. "

I personally think of the Legacy as a little small to be a mid-size but it is a great drive, especially in the Spec-B and GT forms. The Accord is a also a very good car even if it is a little boring to drive. It is boring to me, not to everyone.Even though the Sonata may not be my favorite car in this list, I would agree that it has some appeal, especially the warranty. If you keep a car a long time the long warranty would be appealing. This is what is so great about current auto offerings, there is something for everyone. The bottom line is you have to decide what best fits your needs and makes you happy. Happy motoring.  "

I think the handling of the Subie is much sharper, the steering feel is better, and the overall feel is sportier. I think the tires are grippier, the brakes felt less mushy, and the visibility was better for me. The Accord might be better for someone looking for, for example, crisper handling.I hope it gets better than this. I feel most bumps on the freeway, and the car corners like a wounded farm animal.

In a Camry with narrow tires made me end up going sideways down two lanes on a freeway. Luckily, I was able to keep it going in a direction where I didn't hit anyone, and no one hit me. I felt the tires were undersized, but the suspension being so soft definitely had something to do with it. Obviously, I wasn't used to driving the Parents' Camry.You can change lanes quickly, but don't try and change your ""change"" right after making the change in a Camry! Got it? :P "

Actually, I don't remember them (depending on how long ago that was - I'm turning 20 this month).

It also drove like a truck that was bigger than it was, which is how the Camry drove to me. The Accord is the other way around, though, it drives ""small."" "

Elroy,I concur. I am actually starting to think there is something wrong with mine and the way the sway bars are connected or something. In any event, some H&R ""OE"" style springs should help also. They are conceptually very similar to the Neuspeed ""soft-sport"" springs - only lower the car very slightly and give it a small bump in spring rate.

Legacy has a litle sharper handling, yes, at the expense of a harsher ride. More steering feel perhaps if you like feeling every bump in the road. Grippier tires? Maybe, I haven't tested the Sonata and Legacy back to back in an obstacle course. I like the brake feel of the Sonata and to me it has a bigger greenhouse (except for the Legacy wagon/Outback) and it plenty airy. Legacy has the standout feature of AWD of course, rare in this class.I think the Sonata is superior in interior room and comfort, ride, NVH, fuel economy, warranty and value. "

FE is 23/30 to 24/34, although I seem to regularly beat that highway estimate.I think Subaru discontinued the wagon for '08, which I think is sad, because I previously thought that was one of the standout features for the class, since none of the other midsizers come as a wagon.I actually like hte NVH characteristics of the Subaru. Once underway its quiet but I like that you can feel a little kick when you turn the engine on. I noticed the new Accord actually does this too.Value...well that depends how you measure what is important to you. I think having a 30 mpg AWD wagon with a stick is very important, and getting 16"" alloy wheels, trip computer, compass mirror and all the other goodies were just a bonus, especially for under 20k. "

Up until next year, the Mazda6 still has 3 body styles: sedan, hatchback (some call this a 5-door), and a wagon. The Legacy was on my short list not only because of AWD and a fun driving GT, but also because of the wagon option. In the past I had an Accord hatchback and a Legacy wagon and found the extra hauling capacity handy not only for work but also for moving larger items... and even for taking naps on long road trips :blush: It's too bad the Legacy and Mazda6 won't be making their wagons anymore, but with the Outback and CX-7, there's still good alternatives for buyers of both brands. So from a practical/utility perspective, the Mazda6 and the Passat will be the only cars in this class that will have an expanded cargo carrying capacity over a standard sedan... too bad too, I'd think the average person/family would find extra hauling space would be a good feature that would take away the appeal from heavier and less efficient SUV's which are also more rollover prone.

I'm sure that there must be a demand for such technology or Ford wouldn't have invested in it. But, do we really want to turn our cars into computers more so than they are already?I'm pretty much a basic transportation guy when it comes to vehicles and like our 2000 Focus station wagon just as much as I do our $27,105 MSRP Fusion. Power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, an automatic transmission and I am happy. Heck, the Focus even has crank windows.The bells and whistles trend has far exceeded its usefulness as far as I'm concerned and the Sync idea is nothing more than a gimmick that's likely to go on the fritz in very short order, IMHO.Call me old school, but cars were made for commuting not computing.

I'm very impressed with that video showing the capabilities of Sync. Of course, I'm 26 years old, and am a huge technology fan. I don't spend that much time in a car, so most of my technology is related to other things (example, my car is pretty spartan; but I have GPS tracking and navigation in my new wristwatch (Garmin Forerunner 305), so I can use it anywhere, especially running and biking).What really intruiges me about Sync is that it will be upgradeable with new software packages in the future. Compared to other options available in cars today, that makes it much more appealing. If you are planning on keeping the car for a while, it is nice to know that your high-tech features won't be out of date in a year or two. A few years is a long time in the technology world, and something brand new may come onto the market that appeals to you. All you'll have to do is download the latest patch, and whatever hot new high-tech gadget you want in 5 years will likely be able to ""Sync"" with your car.Pretty cool. "

Call me old school, but cars were made for commuting not computing.I guess I'm old school too. My Accord has a six CD changer, but 99.9% of the time I'm listening to my favorite local radio station (Walton & Johnson in the morning and classic rock all day). My nieces a nefews have all these gadgets, and seems to me they are just toys. The play with them, and play with them, but never really just listen to the music. They spend way more time downloading music than they do listening to it :confuse:. I don't see the need for it. "

I'm all for gadgets if it helps keeps my loved ones and I safe. So I'm all for the latest safety wizardry such as ESC, ABS with Brake Assist, active head restraints, side curtains, etc. I've also become accustomed to certain creature comforts over the years; power windows, locks, mirrors, and remote locking are something I won't do without on a 4-door car. And I'm a real fan of flexible driving positions via seat adjustments (love those dual height adjusters or power ones, and telescopic wheels). Little things that improve passenger comfort are nice, too: center armrests, padded armrests (amazing how even some cars in this class fall down there), lighted vanity mirrors, lots of storage pockets, lots of foot room under the front seats, etc. Other than that, the rest is gravy. Don't need audio controls on the wheel (they're not bad, but I really can do without them). Don't need nav. Don't need Bluetooth (although I can appreciate it). Really don't need a 500 petabyte audio system with built-in data warehouse. Don't need a computer that is too smart for its own good (ala iDrive). Don't need DVD screens (I can always bring along my $80 DVD player if we're on a long trip). Don't need LED lights all over the place, or an auto climate control, or push-button starter.Hard to bellieve my first car, the mid-sized '66 Dodge Coronet, had no carpet, no radio, no A/C, no power anything (except brakes I think), and a 3-speed automatic. But we got by. Really easy to work on that slant 6 engine, though--lots of room in the engnie bay!  "

Your thoughts are along the same thoughts as mine. I don't call power windows, seats, or door locks gadgets though. Most cars except for the cheapest of the cheap come with them anyway. Climate control makes life easier in the cabin, don't need dual controls though. Don't even need cruise. I like the audio controls on the steering wheel, aids in the prevention of distraction from fiddling with the radio. Don't believe in XM/Sirius or NAV. VZ Nav is way cheaper and can be used on foot or bicycle. I'll take leather although leatherette is fine. In this segment, I would want a decent car for family transportation, some amount of creature comforts, efficient, yet lively engine.IMO, when one moves up to LS460 or 750 class it comes with the gadgets. Drove the 750 and it comes with a dizzying array of gadgets, maybe too many. But when you spend $90K for a car that's what you expect and that's what you get. "

&#147;I am struggling with the trend to make everything bigger. The Civic is about the same size as my old Accord&#148;What I find troublesome, except for the Civic and Corolla, mileage for growing subcompacts has skidded down from early 1990s ratings of 31/37 in many cases to 24/32. This is CamCord/Sonata/Optima 4-cylinder mileage territory. Subcompacts that used to weigh 2100&#150;2300# now are now nudging 3000#. The latest Jetta has gone past it now (3230 MT) and is almost the same tonnage as an I4 Sonata (3253 MT). The new Rabbit with a 5-cylinder is rated @22/30. I have read a test where drivers only averaged 19 mpg, another just over 25. At around $3 a gallon and nearly 20k purchase price, what kind of economy car is that? I am aware that these cars have more &#145;stuff&#146; on them, and didn&#146;t accelerate so well, but how about a 2600# subcompact?The 2005 (I think) remake of the Malibu added about 3 mpg. That will be lost in the 2008 conversion to the longer-wheelbase chassis. The new revised mileage ratings will send it down further. Another thing: does everybody have to go from 0-60 in 7 seconds or less? 8 seconds is quite adequate for a lot of people, I think. &#147;the Accord is bigger than the 80s Crown Vics.&#148;On this point, I think you are confused. The LTD began in 1965. The incarnation you referred to started in 1979 as the Galaxie/LTD. It was around 214"" overall length. I don&#146;t know of any Accord that big. Ford did bring out a Fairmount-based vehicle called the LTD in the early 1980s, as a precursor to the Taurus. This may be what you are thinking of. I think the Crown Victoria label was lifted from a fancy 1950s Fairlane to differentiate from its lesser stablemate. "

I'm with you when it comes to my commuter car. I picked up a low end Altima 2.5S with no other options, but ABS. Didn't want or need to all the gadgets on the higher trims. However, you listed out exactly what you want and need, but you still purchased the 'SEL' trim? You could of picked up a base 'S' model or the 'SE' trim if you really needed AWD and/or a V6, which according to you, not really needed from your list of must haves. FWD cars will get better mpg vs. their AWD counterparts. Ford offers low end trims w/o all the toys like every other brand, yet you choose the top of the line trim. Your list of priorities and complaints would of made the Fusion I-4S, your ""dream"" car, yet you chose the top of the line V6 (your mpg complaint), AWD (your mpg complaint), and the SEL trim (your too many gadgets complaint).I'm not following your logic.

A power driver's seat is handy when you have two drivers.We didn't order the car; it was on the lot. In retrospect, an S with an I4 automatic would have been just fine. I have buyer's remorse. The mileage is horrific and we seldom use, or appreciate, all of the bells and whistles.I thought we ""needed"" a V6 because I4s are traditionally anemic. That, too, was a mistake. The AWD is totally uncalled for in our climate.

I think looks can end up being a deciding factor, because the other differences are minor. For instance I could have been comfortable driving an Accord or a Mazda6, but one of the main reasons I bought the 6 is because I think it looks better.It is nice that it looks so good while I am walking to it, because it takes me a long time to get to my car...weighed down, as I am, with a much heavier wallet than I would have had I bought an AccordI agree completely... although the main reasons I bought this car did not involve how the car looked, I still get a certain amount of satisfaction when a stranger walks by and tells me that I have a nice looking car or something to that effect.

Call me old school, but cars were made for commuting not computingThere's deffinitly an age component to it. by the same token, I'd be willing to be you also wouldn't plunk down $600 for an iphone, and niether would I. But those gizmo's and gadgets can separate one car from the other, and for the buyer who isn't really concerned with price, or rather value, It can make the difference in what they buy. The various fan boys of each model can say what they want, most of the cars in this segment are nearly identical performance, handling and reliability wise. Sure, an enthusiast will notice the subtle differences, but the majority of drivers, in bumper to bumper traffic, never will. To me, honda is deffinitly making a bad call if they ignore the tech stuff. Thats the way the market is going, and what the younger buyers will demand. They, along with toyota, will be fine for the next 20-30 years, but the 20 somethings out there now will begin to view the accord and camry as ""grandpa's car"" and look for cars with the gadgets and stuff they want. The asian car companies got where they are today in no small part by always innovating and adding value to their vehicles. I think if they loose that sense of giving you more than you asked for, and stuff not found on other cars, In 20 years we may be discussing what toyota and honda have to do to get back on top of the market.

Some people place value on gadgets, some don'tI never disputed that. What I'm saying is, in the not so distant future, the majority of car buyers will place a lot of value on gadgets. car manufactures ignore that at their own perril. To someone over 30, it doesn't mean much. To the kids out there learning how to drive right now, not having some of those ""gadgets"" will seem as alien to them as a car not having AC does to us older drivers. Their and others desire for tech is already showing up. Take the altima, since I'm posting and reading through that forum, the fully loaded, all the bells and whisles, version of the sedan and coupe are the hardest to find. despite the fact all the gadgets can push the price up over 30k. I don't fault honda, toyota, or any other manufacturer for going after the 40+ buyers, they are the largest demographic buying midsize sedans. But, if they don't cater enough to the younger drivers (their future customers) I think its going to cost them down the road. "

if you push the button once, the car shuts off, no different that removing a conventional key. if (while running) you push it twice in sucession, the car cuts off, but everything else stays on. no pause in the radio, or anything. the motor just stops.and before you ask, no, the car will not shut off if you push the button while it is moving. nothing happens unless you hold it in for about 5 seconds or so.

I don't see how bluetooth connectivity and support for MP3 player in any way challenges the business model for OnStar at this point. They serve different functions.

The big red button from the s2000 is a start but maybe something more contemporary would work well here.IMO, the TSX should be refreshed and do a 6 year cycle. Bring it out about the same time as the next A4. The current A4 is a refresh. The TL... RWD. I finally made up my mind! RWD!! Yeah, not going to happen... I say make another acura model. Let the TL be a GS competitor but being a tad more sporty than luxurious like the GS and the new model [Lets say XL] to be like the ES. The RL just needs to retire or go on hiatus.With all this money honda and Acura are making with all this sales gains, they should really put some into a 4th platform and V8 engine.

Actually, I prefer a stick too, (its what my other 2 cars have) but that doesn't make the CVT any less amazing. To me, there's just something about having almost complete control over the transmission. but thats comparing to a stick, to compare it to an auto, to me, it isn't even close. when I drive my altima, the difference is so profound its kinda hard to describe. I guess my only preference for the stick is more or less feel over function. some CVT's have a ""go cart"" feel to them, but not the xtronic. Its usually reffered to a a ""rubberband"" feel, and I've heard some sentra owners complain of that.As for the sales, 06 was probably off from 05, but wasn't terrible. the altima has always been a top 5 car since the redesign back in 02 that brought it into the midsize family.The 07 redesign finnaly made it capable of competing with the accord and camry. Before 07, it lacked the interior, and build quality to stand toe to toe. "

The CVT on the Altima is absolutely amazing. That was one of the selling points for me. It is unbelievely smooth and efficient. I'm averaging 24 mpg all city w/ only 600 miles so far and the I4 matched with CVT is powerful and butter smooth.The start button is a cool feature, but 5 weeks into my ownership. The novelty has worn off a bit. That said, as simple as taking your keys out of your pocket and turning the ignition. It's been nice not messing with the keys. But I do worry at times about what would happen if the Intellikey decides to de program itself and I can't start the car since there is no slot for the physical key.Nissan decided to provide a slot for the Intellikey if the battery dies in the FOB. There is an actual key inside the FOB you slide out to use to unlock the doors and then slide the FOB into the slot and start the car. However, if the Intellikey just stopped working, you're SOL until your wife/hubby can swing by with the spare. You'd think the engineers would have provided a way to use the key to start the car if needed. I think this will keep many people away from a great car otherwise. "

I remember reading on this forum that several people had mentioned that they thought the interior of the Mazda6 was a bit tight compared to the other cars in this category. Personally, I've had several 6 footers in the back without issue and have rode in the back myself without having a feeling of claustrophobia but since so many people were saying it, I either took them at their word or didn't really care since I had never had a problem with the interior dimensions of the Mazda6. On occasion these comments were coming from Accord proponents so I thought I'd take a peak at this allegation. Here's what I found (according to Honda and Mazda official websites):Headroom (in., front / rear): Accord (EX w/sunroof) - 38.3 / 36.8. Mazda6 5dr(w/sunroof) - 38.0 / 36.7.Legroom (in., front / rear): Accord - 42.6 / 36.8. Mazda6 5dr - 42.3 / 36.5. Hiproom (in., front / rear): Accord - 54.6 / 53.5. Mazda6 5dr - 54.7 / 54.1.Shoulder Room (in., front / rear): Accord - 56.9 / 56.1. Mazda6 5dr - 56.1 / 54.9Cargo Volume (cu. ft.): Accord - 14.0. Mazda6 5dr - 22.1 (58.7 with rear seats folded down). The strange thing is, I never hear that the Accord is cramped or small, but I hear that alot when the 6 is described.... perhaps people are using overall interior space to come up with their conclusions, but if that volume includes area where people don't reside or use (like under the windshield above the dash), who cares? I guess this confirms what I was thinking before, the Mazda6 has enough room for most people to be comfortable and is competitive for this class. "

I used to think the Mazda6 was tight in back, but recently I sat in a car with the power driver's seat, and when I adjusted it so it was fairly high up (for good thigh support), I was also able to move it prety far forward and be comfortable. (I'm 5'10"".) At that setting, there was plenty of room in the back seat for me, and there was good foot room since the front seat was so high. So I think numbers can be misleading wrt actual stretch-out room in back. A lot depends on the seat geometry, amount of toe space, etc. The Accord also has pretty good rear leg room, but feels claustrophobic to me (especially with the black interior) compared to some other cars in this class such as Camry, Optima, and Sonata.

Why are you comparing a hatchback with a sedan? It doesn't change much, here is sedan to sedan comparison:Headroom (in., front / rear): Accord (EX w/sunroof) - 38.3 / 36.8. Mazda6 Sedan(w/sunroof) - 38.0 / 37.1. Legroom (in., front / rear): Accord - 42.6 / 36.8. Mazda6 Sedan - 42.3 / 36.5. Hiproom (in., front / rear): Accord - 54.6 / 53.5. Mazda6 Sedan - 54.7 / 54.1. Shoulder Room (in., front / rear): Accord - 56.9 / 56.1. Mazda6 Sedan - 55.9 / 55.2 Cargo Volume (cu. ft.): Accord - 14.0.

We traded in a 2000 Mazda Miata MX-5 convertible with only 7,500 miles on it.The problem with gadgets, bell and whistles, is when they cease to function properly and have to be fixed. It's often very expensive to fix a gadget.The Fusion, after eight months and 4,200 miles, has been perfect in that regard but who knows what the future will bring?Our lone complaint is poor gas mileage, but even our 2000 Ford Focus station wagon with a 2.0-liter I4 and automatic transmission only gets 18-20 mpg driving the same route so I guess the Fusion's 14.8 mpg isn't all that bad considering it is a 3,300-pound mid-size sedan with a V6 and AWD.Still, I think FoMoCo would be better served if it devoted more resources toward better fuel economy rather than gadgets like Sync "

Not from what I understand. If the ""key"" does have a malfunction, the car can sense it, and flashes a warning on the trip computer. This allows you to still run the car with the fob in the slot to the left of the steering wheel. This is from what I understand from the owners manual. So you use the actual key to unlock the door. Slide the FOB into the slot near the steering wheel and the FOB will start the car even though the Intellikey craps out. Interesting, guess it's time to crack open the owner's manual. I hope I never have the opportunity to find out. "

The Accord's back seat is not the roomiest in this segment, that's for sure.I don't think it was optimized for people; it is fantastic for child restraints. Each position does an excellent job of holding a child/infant seat using the LATCH system. The bench is flat and does a great job of holding the infant seat in the correct position and it's very easy to get the seat in there good and tight. I find the backseat of the Subaru more comfortable for people (2 medium sized adults is the limit, but my family runs small), but because of the seat belt arrangement it is difficult to use a rearward facing infant seat in the center position. Because of the door shape, it is more difficult to load the babyseat into the cradle with the Subie than the Accord. "

Why are you comparing a hatchback with a sedan? Mostly because I have one, and that was the car type I was looking at on Mazda's website before I began comparing the Accord to the 6. Doesn't really matter anyway... the sedan and hatchback have similar dimensions except for the storage capacity.I'd avoid a hatchback because of the lessened structural rigidity (more rattles) since I will keep a car a long time.My Honda Accord hatchback held up pretty well as did my Legacy wagon, so I headed into the Mazda6 hatchback with a fair amount of confidence that they would be pretty solid. Having that much more useable space with these two body types in my previous cars made this a pretty important feature that I wanted to have. I just am annoyed that sedans don't use their space as effectively as hatchbacks or wagons. And if you don't want a car that has less structural rigidity, the mazda6 feels more solid than the accord even in hatchback form... although the accord has a very solid feel, the mazda felt like it handles the twisties with a bit more composure.

From my understanding, Its not the Ikey that starts the car, per se. the sensors in the car scan for it, or rather the signal it puts out. if the car can not pick up that signal, it won't enable the starter. What the slot does, is puts the Ikey extremly close a sensor (not sure if its a different one) so its easier to detect the fob. Now I'm not a 100% sure of this next part, but i've read that the sensor behind the slot send out a signal that actually has a very, very, very small current to it that can power the Ikey just enough to send out its signal. I suppose you could test that by removing the battery from you Ikey, putting it the slot, then trying to start your car. "

Well as an anti-chromite, I find the new grill less offensive. Maybe because it doesn't have the extra 2 bars of chome lower down??? Or maybe I am overlooking the chrome because the headlights and tailights are less offensive (to me) in the rendering of the '09 vs. the current version.Also this may move the fusion ahead of the Mazda6 for me because, if the images of the mazda6 are accurate, it looks they are going to the (hated by me) chrome around the side windows, while ford just has the less offensive line of chrome at the base of the windows.Anyway, I'd prefer it with the optional ""black chrome"" grill that I assume will continue to be available on the next version...but I'd want them to make that version of the grill a stand alone option or let me buy it as a part and switch it.Glad I got my Mazda6 with chrome-free exterior (aside from the Mazda symbol) and woodless interior while that is still an option.

All of you probably are sick of my raving about the hauling capacity of hatchbacks, but every time I'm able to get something into my Mazda6 hatchback that would not fit into a sedan I am that much happier that I made the choice I did.I've always been satisfied with my car, but more so when I overheard some people walking by my car saying some nice things about it as I was waiting for my queen sized bed frame with a high backrest to get pulled from their full service area. While I was waiting, I see many people in sedans trying to figure out how to get their purchases into their cars... several drove off with boxes precariously hanging out of their trunk since their packages would not fit through the cabin pass through. Others had to take their furniture out of the protective boxes to get them to fit in their cars. Finally after around 30 minutes of waiting, I saw my package # show up on the IKEA screen saying that my purchase was ready to pick up and be loaded. As has happened before, the person helping me load laughed as I pointed out my car and said, ""You're going to put THIS in THAT?!"" When we were able to get it to fit without any problems, the guy said, ""Very cool! Nice car! What is it?""

The total length of the Elantra Touring from back entry to just behind the front seatbacks would be an interesting measurement length to have and compare with say, a Mazda6 hauling machine. zzzoom6, BTW, I don't grow tired of your praising of your Mazda6. If you love it, you do, and that is true.Oh, pfflyer, someone re-introduce auto haiku again to Edmunds! Maybe I'll suggest it. "

The only drawback I've noticed is that they lack some potential cross-bracing in the rear, giving up some body stiffness.Which is why Mazda probably chose the sedan for its Mazdaspeed6. Strange thing is, Mazda chose the wagon for the Mazdaspeed3... And of course the hatchback weighs a bit more with all that glass in the back window (some have argued that this is a good thing in that the weight distributions is a bit more equal...I think that argument is a stretch though. this logic would suggest I should put a bunch of lead weights in the back). So perhaps it does not handle as well as the mazda6 sedan, but when I test drove the sedan I didn't notice a huge difference. Both have a tremendous amount of grip when cornering and both still corner flatter than anything else in this class. Now that I've got this bed frame home, I'm now not so sure having the ability to haul these things home is such a good thing... my room is now in a shambles trying to make room to put together this thing! Sorry, no pics of my sanctuary, especially in it's current condition! Alright, break is over... gotta get back to work. "

Which is why Mazda probably chose the sedan for its Mazdaspeed6.That is precicely why they chose the sedan. In fact, you can't fold the rear seat backs down in the SPEED6 because of extra bracing that was added that would block the opening to the trunk and make that feature useless. "

I have an '06 Speed6. The seats fold down, but there is a panel in the trunk that must be removed (no big deal, just five plastic clips). The cross braces are a little sharp, but you can use some rubber trim or foam insulation to cover it up. This is not listed as a feature because the braces get in the way, but for skis or lumber, it works great. I still vote the Speed6 the deal of the decade for the under $24K many people paid for them. This is a great car. Power, handling, comfort, AWD, best brakes for under $50K, and good looks, too. There are still some '07s available. I wonder what they are going for? "

I like the looks of the interior a lot... reminds me of the Tribeca but maybe less futuristic. Anyways, I like it. But the button fetish that has shown up in the more recent Acuras is maybe a bit much. I suppose if the buyer goes without nav, maybe the 30+ buttons that are pictured will be shaved down to more manageable levels. But the flow is nice, and I really like how the inside of the doors look: nice accents, colors and textures. But the exterior of the sedan still hasn't impressed me too much. It really reminds me of a saturn from several years ago. There seems to be no flow... like a bunch of elements designed to grab people's attention (the crease on the side, the ""cyst-like"" bulge in the headlights, the alloy wheels) just slammed together and end up looking a bit forced. I know Honda has some great designers... the TSX, TL, and even the RL have great flow and balance that attracts interest whereas the Accord sedan tries to make a statement without actually pulling it off. Fortunately, the exterior of the coupe looks dynamic and sleek. And the blunt butt seems to match the rest of the design on the coupe whereas the same element looks out of place on the sedan. I especially like the rear side window and the lower crease on the lower 1/4 on the side of the car.Can't wait to drive it... hope the clutch on the 6 speed manual isn't as abrupt as the writer's of the edmunds article say though. But the engine, as expected, sounds like a gem in both 4 and 6 cylinder forms. And the v-6 that drops to 3 or 4 cylinders depending on driving conditions sounds very interesting. Having a suspension that appears to be a bit more firm on the v-6 coupe is a move that I welcome and I can't wait to try it. September looks to be a great month... the next generation Mazda6 at Frankfurt and test driving the new Accord coupe!  "

Still seems like an unnecessary gimmick to me and one that could lead to problems down the road. How durable are the active engine mounts that keep the engine from vibrating when it's only running on 3 or 4 cylinders for example?Aside from that, I think I like it. I'll have to see it in person to be sure though. I do like the Tribeca-like interior though. Shave off some buttons thought. What is with Honda and all these buttons all of a sudden? And for the love of God, integrate the CD slot rather than having it look like some tacked on afterthought!

Toyota still has their hybrid version and Honda dropped theirs in favor of the cylinder mgmt and a forthcoming diesel. We'd be wise to see how that all pans out before making such judgments IMO.Also, Edmunds says the V6 Accord sedan will be slower than the Altima by a couple of tenths. Isn't the Camry V6, with the 6-speed ATX, faster than that?The 6-speed in the Fusion also does a lot for that smaller engine. It's no barnstormer but it does put up respectable numbers that would be worse if not for the 6-speed ATX.I think Honda could have really pulled away if they used a 6-speed ATX.

And the rear really does look like a Saturn, as others have noted--or maybe a Sonata without the taillamp extensions on the trunk. So nothing special exterior-wise. The swoopy coupe is, as in past generations, far superior to the sedan in the looks department.

Anybody read the MotorTrend comparo of the 2008 Accord v-6 to the Camry SE? Pretty interesting... they actually felt that the Camry was the better car in the twisties! I have heard that the SE was more responsive and had a sportier suspension, but still, I am very surprised by this. They do say that the Accord has much less body roll than before which I am very happy about. And they go on to confirm that the coupe is sportier than the sedan, saying ""The last time a Honda coupe offered these levels of style and performance it wore the Prelude nameplate."" On the other hand the coupe, since cylinder deactivation will not be available on this body style, gas mileage is less than stellar with 17 mpg city, and 25 mpg hwy. Car and Driver also mention that they felt the sedan was pretty huge...almost the size of a 300 in length. I hope it doesn't feel ""boatish"" because of this... but all the reviews don't indicate this to be the case, but I'm sure it's growth in size will be hard to miss. They write, ""Lots of car here, and a great deal of seriousness. No more frisky four-door provocateur of tire-squealing feats, although the 200-hp four shows that old Honda magic when you let it wail. But the car itself, even with the energetic V-6 up front, is good-citizen polite, a bit parental in its reserve. The average buyer age is now 50; these folks expect their four-doors to have expansive space. The floor is lower by 0.38 inch compared to previous Accords, for more leg- and kneeroom, and the rear seat was pushed back an inch. Factor in the extra inch and a half of cabin width, and, Accord, we hardly know ya.You&#146;re 32, going on 64."" "

I don't think the sixth gear is that important in general on a family sedan. It is not one of the deal breakers for me.Totally agree with you. However, it could have been even more with the extra gear and really made the competition try to catch up in a hurry. As it stands it's not really ahead of anyone aside from fuel econ. Even there it's not the best because Toyota has the Camry hybrid, Nissan the Altima hybrid, and Ford will soon release the Fusion hybrid. None offer the performance of the Accord's V6 but if fuel econ is your primary concern then you should not buy any V6. Is it a nice compromise? Yes, but there are better compromises (see above hybrids) that offer decent performance and outstanding fuel econ.Seems like with some of the other stuff they moved to the head of the pack again. Like what? To get the beter I4 you have to get the coupe which is moronic IMO. The interior is a cross between the current Mazda6 and the Subaru Tribeca. Nice, but not anything new. The new V6 has great fuel econ but is not the performance leader (as far as we know so far) so there are better choices if performance is your game or if fuel econ is your game. For example, if performance were my game (which is usually is FWIW) the Accord V6 wouldn't be my first choice because I could be beaten by an Altima. Possibly the next Mazda6 too. If fuel econ were my game I'd be getting a hybrid or the I4 option. To me, nothing about this new Accord really stands out and separates it from the pack to the point that I'd have to say ""Wow!!!

Overall it is busier than my 06 is, although it doesn't seem to integrate any extra functions into the interface.So, if we're keeping a scorecard, mine would goExterior Styling - AInterior Styling - B+Interior Ergonomics - B-As with a lot of things, seeing the car in person could change my mind altogether in both respects (for the better or worse).

 don't think the sixth gear is that important in general on a family sedan. It is not one of the deal breakers for me. and it beginsI got to laugh at that one. Just like other discussions here, if it's not on the accord, then it shouldn't be on a car. everything that the accord has that other cars don't makes it better, and what other cars have that the accord doesn't is unnecessary, pointless, and just a gimmick.As for my opinions, the '08 is about what I expected. They're still shooting for the 45+ midlevel management type and little old ladies. Bigger, and just about as conservative. But, I do like the engine choices they're offering. a 200hp I4 seems very impressive to me. Even the 180hp version of the I4 will be the highest in the midsize category now.It will be real interesting to see the pricing on them. "

Wrong, look at both cars, '03 Accord and '06 Sonata--lamps are much different in shape. The '08 Accord's lamps now match the shape of those on the Sonata, with the sides canted back from top to bottom.

Well the Accord is starting to look a bit blended, as most cars seem to be. People say the Aura was the fresh look or a Sonata is sort of like this or that, and well they all look like a blend of Euro knock-offs. I think the starting point was Passat for the Altima, which was pretty cool for the bucks, and the Camry has the bangle butt off the BMW3. Oh heck, what is the difference, since 1968 it has all been downhill. The Big 3 had the look back then. And in Euro cars, well I don't know, they had great looking sports cars dating back to 1950's. For the most part, the mid-sized and full sized cars are now all too tall doors, with some having the chop top look. Great, just great, like I want a modern day Merc chop top. Even sports cars have the too tall doors, and you now sit in a bathtub to drive. Very few graceful looking cars, and few with any wow factor at all. I wouldn't mind some though, like an SLK. In a mid-sized sedan, my '07 Accord looks fine, nothing over the top and nothing to right home about, just modern and areo dynamic. Not quite a Jag for looks though  There is the new Malibu, which once again looks like another nicely blended car, as in all the rest. The new Bimmer 3 are looking pretty good. Altima I guess is the only less expensive car with some extra style.L "

But for my wants and needs, the Mazda6 was the smarter choice, especially considering I was able to get it for 4K less than a comparable Accord.

I have to admit that I'm too much of a (I want power and I want gas mileage at the same time!) kind of a guy to have ever even test driven the Mazda 6. When you combine somewhat poor gas mileage with somewhat poor power at the same time, you won't get on my ""gotta have it list.""Aren't you the one with the Fusion? I haven't heard you complain about the amount of power in your car even though you have power sapping awd and an automatic yet we share the same engine. And when a couple car magazines have tested the Mazda6 w/ mtx 0-60 times in the mid 6 seconds, I'm not too sure where you can reasonably say ""somewhat poor power"". Yeah, 215 hp vs 268 hp is a big difference, but it's more what a car can do with the power that matters IMO. 0-60 times differ with the higher HP cars by about .5 of a second... not that big of a difference. And it's not like I'm looking to beat every car at a stoplight off the line anyway. That's why I prefer a car that handles well in turns and in braking rather than a car that drag races really well. As far as gas mileage goes, there was a couple weeks where I was doing all office work so I was only doing city driving with a few hills and tons of stop and go in traffic on the way home. I got 18 mpg in that all city driving. And on my longer business trips, I got 27 mpg plus while averaging 80 mph the majority of the way on a highway that had a fair amount of hills. This is better mpg than the new Accord coupe w/ v-6! And I am not gentle on the throttle either... while not rabidly tailgating and manically speeding, if the opportunity presents itself to pass someone or take a corner quicker than most, I will do so. And on the highway, the ratio of cars I pass vs being passed is around 10:1. Now I have no doubt if I were driving an Accord v-6 w/ a mtx, I'd probably get better mpg... but how much gas can I buy with the $4000 I saved when I got the Mazda6 vs the Accord? Probably a lot. "

Interior fit and finish (to me) is not upto Accord standards, and the new Accord goes one up Unfortunately we weren't talking about fit and finish but rather the actual quality of the interior materials. At least I wasn't anyway. Look at the pics zzzoom posted of his 6's interior and tell me how the shiny silver plastic in the new Accord is any different than what you see there. If what you've been renting are newer copies of the 6 then you are probably seeing the newer all black center stack which IMO is a step down from the original silver and the silver in the Accord and Camry. The entire dash and most of all the doors in the 6 are covered with a high quality, soft to the touch material that has a leather grain look to it.So you could be right about the fit and finish between the two but honestly, fit and finish are not on my radar anymore because I haven't owned a car with rattles or squeaks inside since our '96 Civic. And even in that car the squeaks and rattles didn't show up for 3 or 4 years. I'm not concerned with a few mm between panel pieces as long as they don't make noise. I'm not actually concerned with the quality of the interior materials either and tend to focus on the driving experience when I'm shopping. Not everyone does that, hence our discussion of interiors.

The Sonata's lamps fit its rear end perfectly--which is why Hyundai chose that design; not because it bore even a faint resemblance to the Accord's lamps.Just as Honda had no intention of copying anyone (except its own TL, perhaps) with the '08 Accord design.

First of all, I think you have me confused with another Andres, or Andre1969???I opted for the 2003 Accord LX V6 Coupe back in November of 2002, and kept it for 65,000 miles, 50 months, and sold it for 53% of the out the door 25K price I got it for (had 16"" polished aluminum alloy wheels thrown in to make it every bit as good as the EX V6 Coupe (except for no leather and no moonroof; things that I didn't want anyway).I averaged 25-26 MPG in mixed driving with heavy San Diego traffic and I drive much like you do, if not slightly more aggressively (a lot as you described), with probalby a 15:1 ratio of passing people to being passed. On long trips, even driving through LA traffic (always a hiccup), I was able to average 30 MPG going 80-85 MPH whenever I could and traffic would allow. All this with just the 5 speed Auto.In regards to preferring a great handler and braker to a great drag racer, I say this: I want both! Why can't you have the best of both? Or at least NEAR the best of both? "

AS for performance, we haven't seen any Mazda 6 beat an Accords performance, and I don't expect that to change. says 03accordman ""Then I said: This is the Honda-holic's attitude in spades... whatever facts don't fit with their view, they ignore. Ok, how about braking, where the Accord stops 10 feet longer according to the Edmunds midsize comparo - or were you thinking a bigger # is better? Or how about that the Accord tested in the same comparo to be able to do the slalom at 60 mph where the Mazda6 was able to do it at 65 mph. The Accord has many strengths, but to overstate and exaggerate how good it is does nothing but make me think you are a indeed a Honda-holic. then 03accordman responded with: I have always maintained Handling wise the 6 is superior to the Accord - the slalom superiority would come in there, right? Or are your glasses too tinted to see praise from unexpected quarters? Ok, try to reconcile your two statements...they contradict each other a bit eh? I'm more than happy to accept compliments from others, particularly from ""unexpected"" people. But look at your first statement...where was the praise exactly? Seems to me you were saying that the accord was, and will continue to be (even though you have yet to drive one and no review of the new accord has said that it is the handling leader in this class) superior in all aspects including performance. Did I paraphrase you incorrectly by being too literal in defining your own words?""When I said performance, I was referring to power/acceleration/fuel economy. Was not referring to handling, which I already agreed to be better on the 6. See any contraditcion there? "

The plastics and other materials in the 6 and the Accord are extremely similar. How they look all mashed together is where the difference lies and that varies from person to person.

If they were talking about the current Altima (and not an 03 model), a Passat (not the Jetta), or an Accord interior, I would be impressed. But those two were pretty easy to beat, IMO. I have some more for you in case you didn't actually read the entire comparo I posted.From that same C&D comparison of the 6, Altima, and Jetta.The Jetta's interior is clean, attractive, comfortable, and cool. Its solid, substantial feel is attributable to class-leading build-quality demonstrated by perfect paint, tight gaps, and nary a squeak or rattle. All the buttons, wheels, and knobs are damped and complement that oh-so-German black-rubber dash pad and the fold-flat ventilation outlets. Indigo-blue and red instrumentation, with logically located switchgear, is now a common VW trait, but it still looks as good as it works. The trunk is impeccably finished, with a full-size spare and brushed-stainless-steel gas strut to boot. There's a reason VW/Audi are often benchmarked for interior design--they're that good.You'll find the same comments on pretty much any VW interior no matter where you look. Still think the 6 won that contest easily? :P "

When you think about it all automobiles are appliances made for passenger transport. There are some that transport in a more vigorous manner. Those have room for only two passengers..little to no luggage...and cost more than my last two or three years salaries. Then there are a few with 4 doors that transport 4 passengers with vigor..their luggage..and cost more than one years salary. Then there is the rest they transport me, my wife, an occasional passenger or two. It should get out its own way (0-60 mph in around 7 seconds or so) and gets out of that semi's way at the end of the on-ramp. Gets 20 mpg around town and 28-30 mpg on the highway. Is fairly quiet and reasonably comfortable. It doesn't roll over at the first curve in the road. Has a nice hot heater and cold A.C. Has to be fairly nice to look at for 5 years or however long it takes to pay it off. And ideally it isn't in the shop for an undue amount of time. This pretty much sums up what most people are looking for so if that makes my choice an appliance so be it.

I'll go out on a limb and predict that the Accord will be a sales success and sell even more Accords in 2008 than 2007. I'm not so sure they will. not because of anything honda did in the redesign, but midsize car sales have been dropping for nearly a decade now. And now, more than ever, people want smaller, more fuel efficent cars, and or hybrids. For the last decade, the asian car companies have been doing alright by taking away from the domestics, but how much lower can they drive them?I think honda took a pretty big gamble with making it bigger, less fuel efficent. That seems to be contray to where the market is heading. It could pay off big if people (after a test drive) decide they want the bigger car. But it could also go the other way. "

It may not be less fuel efficient. My 2007 was EPA rated at 26/34, before the revised numbers.

Look at the slalom test scores, 0-60 scores, lateral G testing and such, over the years then see how well the modern day sedan is -- just awesome. OK, it is not a Miata or a Porsche, but these cars are not old boats of days-gone-bye. Style wise, they look modern and sleek, with little to no wow factor. Yes, we need to get the wow back.

If you buy it with a sunroof, it's back into mid-size range (interior + trunk = >120 cu sq ft). On the mileage, all their engines are either more efficient than the previous generation or equally as efficient. Regardless of how they achieve that, that's the situation. "

Fuel economy isn't too shabby either - 28.8 MPG overall average with speeds between 75 and 80 on the freeways - and, that MPG includes the driving in various cities while on the business trip.

Personally I expect a Japan make to use no more than a quart every 5,000 to perhaps 7,500 miles. But eight tenths per thousand, I think not. How did the VWs do in the latest Consumer Reports magazine? Ever price the transmission repair on one? Yes, they look cool, and seem to have a nicely done interior.

The Passat V6, which btw has the distinction of being the most expensive as-tested Family Sedan CR has tested, is Recommended by CR, and has above-average predicted reliability. The 2.0T has below-average reliability and thus is not recommended by CR. Also, the 2.0T is (as tested) about $5000 more than the 2nd-ranked Altima.

Take a pretty solid car, under power it when introduced, make it perhaps a bit too plain, though I wouldn't say ugly, give her a name, then yank the name off in a year or two -- oh dear-dear. New engine, and some bling-bling chrome, with a bull name, will do the trick? Hey, I am not paid the big bucks, so perhaps the CEO is on to some very large plan here to save FiveHundred project. It would be sad to see it fail if it is a good car. I had a PT with the high seat position. Good around town, but nothing I liked for the open roads / country roads twisty driving.

Yeah they keep me fed and leaving my clothes smelling like an Irish spring morning (whatever that is...), but if they were to get dirty, dented, or even if they would break, I don't think I'd give a rip. But a car is so much more than these appliances... there is something visceral about how a car accelerates, corners and moves. For me, driving is almost therapy... it lets me forget about all the other things that may be happening and for that moment when I commit to taking that corner rated for 20 mph at 45 mph, there is faith, exhilaration, maybe even a little doubt, but my mind is focused on the car, on every little twitch, the tension of the steering wheel, remembering how much force my backside is being forced into the seat bolsters, and making sure that I know where the brake pedal is... just in case. Then I hit the apex, the tires are screeching, my heart is racing, but the car is still in my control... a small smile starts to appear on my face and all in the world is glorious! I take a deep breath and think, ""I love this car! I am soooo lucky to have made this choice!"" Never in a million years would I ever get the same emotions and level of satisfaction from a clothes washer. Yeah, it is still a way to get from point a to b, but if that's all it was, I'd get a corolla. But cars mean more to me than that, especially when it comes down to MY car. It's an expression, an amusement ride, my therapist, my tour guide, my hobby, my addiction, my means to an end... There's a reason I, and dare I say ""we"", spend a good part of our day reading, writing, and even arguing about cars and not about refrigerators: we use appliances because we have to, and yes, in my current condition I have to drive my car, but I also do it because I like to.

And now the question becomes: What defines fun? In my opinion there is a fine line between having ""fun"" while driving and reckless driving. Are those who pass me on a curve in the mountains having fun? Do they do so because their car can corner better than mine at speed? Do those who blow by me at 100 mph on a curvy 2 lane do that while having fun (a Corvette did just that not too long ago)? I like my ""fun"" every now and then but like most people I just go back to using my ""appliance"" like it was intended to be used 99% of the time.

There are plenty of opportunities to have ""fun"" without even being close to breaking the law. It's all in how you look at it.Zzzoom is right. All of us spend a fair amount of time reading, talking, and debating about cars, more than the average joe (and MUCH more than my wife!) That's why we're passionate about our cars, because they're much more than just ""moving appliances"" to us. I'm proud of that, and you should be as well. If not, I don't think this board is right for you.Just because the majority of us drives midsize sedans, doesn't mean that we CAN'T enjoy what (and how) we drive. I'd LOVE to have a two-door, two-seat supercar, but it's not practical for me and my life. Why can't we have our cake and eat it too? "

Also ask VW what they would consider excessive oil consumption for an engine. It is 8/10 Qt. per 1,000 miles. To me that is plain wrong. Now, what I do not know is if this is some standard reply in the industry.Yes, the typical industry standard is that up to 1 quart per 1000 miles is okay. So this is not a VW thing. Our VW has not used a detectible amount in 20,000+ miles.I think the actual reliability differences are a lot less than many think. When my wife bought the brand new model Jetta in 2005, a no deductible extended warranty to 7 years/100,000 miles was about $1500. For an Accord, the exact same warranty from the same source (our credit union) would have cost about $1000. VW's are ususally highly rated by CR in terms of quality and drivability. They only complain about the reliability, based on data from their flawed survey. "

From what I've heard, the 3.5L simply wasn't ready. After having driven both, and lived with the 3.5L for the 1,400 mile trip, I can assure you the 3.5L has some serious ""grunt,"" and it's quiet too, not thrashy. I drove about 15% in the city, and 85% on interstates, with a 28.8MPG average. And, in response to Loren's post, on twisty two lane roads in Mississippi and Alabama, it wasn't too bad either - no Accord mind you, but equal to or better than the Camry SE I last rented.Also, I prefer the upright seating position akin to a SAAB, Volvo, or many European cars, compared to the ""legs out"" position of other cars. After miles and miles of interstate driving, I'm still comfortable, unlike when I'm driving a car without that seating position. In some respects, the Five Hundred/New Taurus is a more affordable Volvo anyway, since it's built on the Volvo S80 platform - not a bad thing. "

Actually, the new Taurus is built on the D3 platform which is a modified version of the previous gen S80 platform.And the 3.5L engine was at least 2 years later than anticipated so they would have had to postpone the Five Hundred, Freestyle and Montego for 2 years if they waited for the engine. The 3.0L was simply a stopgap measure. Same is true for the Zephyr - it was supposed to debut as the MKZ with the 3.5L but they needed something for Lincoln/Mercury dealers to sell last year after they killed the LS. "

Most of us only drive at less than 50% of the capability of most modern cars in this class anyhow. A V-6 Sonata for instance is fast enough (as fast as or faster than 90% here) gets similar fuel economy, is as quiet as any here, and handles and stops as well also so it is the appliance of choice for thousands ($$$ for thousands LESS $$$). It becomes nit-picking trying to define what is an enthusiasts sedan. I can scare the hell out of myself in an Accord as easily as in a Camry..just before I drop back down into a sedate cruise for the remainder of my trip.

One of my all-time favorite things to do, ever, is to drag race a cop. I'm not kidding, it is hilarious. Almost every car being discussed here can really hand it to a Crown Vic off the line.I love it when one is next to me at a red light and after it turns green, I hear that Ford V8 start to rumble. I'll scoot as fast as I possibly can up to the speed limit, wasting the cop car in the process, and then cruise along. Every single time I have tried this, without fail, the cop leaves it floored and absolutely blasts past me at 15-20 mph over the limit. If we get caught again at the next light, we just repeat. Every cop has repeated.Don't peel tires, just floor it to the speed limit. Nothing illegal about that. And it is so much fun. "

The Mazda6 has been going at very low prices for a long time; and it is a tough value to beat (especially now with a new gen coming out).

Funny you should mention low prices on Accords. The Honda dealerships in my town seem to have an unwritten (since written would be against the law) agreement not to publish purchase prices, just lease prices. And the lease deal on the Accord LX right now is worse than it was earlier in the year: still $199/month but nearly $3000 up front. The up-front money is much higher than it was earlier this year. In fact, earlier in the year the deal was $199/mo. for a V6! That seems odd to be given Honda must be trying to close out the Accords before the new models roll in.Personally I like the size of the current Mazda6 and don't like the trend of making mid-sized cars larger (on the outside). The new Accord is 194"" for gosh sakes! That's about 6"" less than the huge Grand Caravan I had. And it was a cumbersome beast to park. Other automakers seem to be able to fit mid-sized space (even large-car space) into a smaller package. Maybe Honda should add a large sedan ala Avalon to its lineup so it can let the Accord play the role of mid-sized family sedan and keep it a decent size. "

Honda already brought the Fit over here because the Civic is now the size of the original Accord (or bigger?).

Length of a car does not exactly measure usable space - interior volume, trunk space.Interior volume is not always the best measure either. Somewhat lower roofline reduces interior volume, but does not change a mid-size to a compact no matter what EPA thinks. (Malibu is a mid-size and G6 is a compact per EPA.)Adding a sunroof also does not convert a large car to a midsize. While interior space is important, exterior dimensions, wheelbase. and weight are also important factors in classifying cars as these affect how it drives. EPA may think the Sonata and the Crown Vic are in the same size class, personally I think the 2 foot difference in length puts them in different classes. Of course, actually EPA also recognizes this which is why they have market class which ""groups together cars that are similar from the car buyer's perspective"", in addition to the official EPA size classification based on interior volume. The ""market class"" sensibly puts the Sonata in the ""family sedan"" category and the Crown Vic in the ""large sedan"" category.http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass.htm "

cause the camry hasn't grown that large, they still keep the avalon bigger to fill that spot.

I seem to remember reading somewhere that over the last 10 years or so, they're down about a million units. just look at the trend. the accord sales peaked in 2001-2002. the civic, versa, and crv (i know its a suv/cuv, but it is the small version) are way up. same way with toyota. their fastest growing cars are the matrix, yarris, carolla. nissan and Gm are an exception, but the versa is selling as fast as they can make them, and the altima was made smaller this time arround. and if the sentra were a better car, it might be cutting into altima sales. same with gm. I think they only reason the impala does as well as it does is because the malibu and cobalt are such poor choices.As said before, It may work. Honda is usually very good at guessing the market.

Whereas the Accord grew nearly 6-1/2"" in length from 2007 to 2008 and is now five inches longer than the Camry (and also the Sonata, although the Sonata actually has more interior room than the Accord).

Look back on the previous page of this thread, if you would, and tell me you see 6-1/2"". I see 3"" longer and 1"" wider, and 1"" taller. Not a huge difference, IMO. It seems bigger is better (to you) when it's the Sonata, but no so for the Accord. What's up with that? "

Sonata: 188.9Camry: 189.2Accord: 194.1I should have used a calculator the first time--it's actually almost 5-1/2"", not 6-1/2"". But if you see only 3"", I guess you need glasses? Bigger is better when it doesn't make the car a cumbersome size. The Camry and Sonata manage to house roomy interiors with less length. Actually, the Camry and Sonata are longer than I like/need. I prefer cars like the Elantra and Versa that are roomy inside (mid-sized car volume) but compact outside--in this case nearly a foot and a half shorter than the Accord. The Elantra puts more interior volume than the '07 Accord EX into 177 inches. I suppose some folks like big (long) cars, but I don't see the benefit unless it translates into more useable room. Parking spaces seem to be getting smaller, and I'm not accumulating less stuff in my garage every year.  "

Yes, I looked up the number for the 2007 Accord but didn't notice it was for the coupe. Thanks for the correction.If 5-1/2"" is not a big difference for you, that's great.

If I have choice between a ""mid-sized sedan"" that's 194"" or one that's 177"", I prefer the shorter, easier to park car. Or if I have a choice between two sedans that have about the same interior space, I prefer the one that's almost half a foot shorter.I can't wait for the Gen 9 Accord--will probably give my old Grand Caravan a run for its money in length. :sick: Maybe it will have footrests in back though.

I think your have to sit in the car to evaluate the interior roominess. Roominess is function of interior ergonomics not of cubic feet.

Honda is probably spot-on as far as what most Americans want, i.e., bigger is better (see: Suburban).

Honda did add more interior volume for 2008, but that doesn't impress me given some of their competitors have already done that, but with more efficient packaging.But Honda is smart, and it's all probably part of their plan to make the next Fit compact-class, and the next Civic mid-sized class.

I couldn't afford 15 MPG of a pickup or large SUV, so the midsize MPG was the best compromise I could find.

Did you try the Elantra at the time you got your Accord? More front leg room than the 2006 Accord (43.2 vs. 42.6 inches, although the new-for-2007 Elantra has 43.5""). Since the old Accord fits you, the Elantra might also.So, leg room isn't necessarily a function of vehicle size. Another example is the Versa. The 5-door is only 169"" long, or over two feet shorter than the 2008 Accord. But I found it has more stretch-out rear leg room (including lots of toe space) than the two-classes-bigger Altima, when I had the driver's seats adjusted for comfort. It felt like a limosine in back! Definitely one of those ""try before you buy"" things. "

There were other factors that caused me to want a car the Accord's size; including a pretty amazing power-to-economy ratio, plenty of room all-around, and a bit of a heavier car made the parents happy. I was coming from a 1996 Accord (which I still drive some), so stepping into an Elantra would probably feel like I was going backwards (not a 07 of course, but the 2001-2006 model). Honestly, I never set foot in an Elantra because the dated looks turned me off. Lots of car for the money, but if it is a car you don't want, you've wasted your money good deal or not, right?My whole point was to say that not everyone feels that more room is bad, just like not everyone feels like a bigger car is good.

I guess I should have stated it more clearly.I am not uncomfortable in my current vehicles, a 1996 Accord (compact) and a 2006 Accord (midsize). Would I welcome more legroom? Whole heartedly. Am I cramped or uncomfortable though? Nah. I like the idea of having stretch out space, but I have never had a problem traveling in my Accord, driving for long periods of time (10 hours at a time, only stopping for lunch/gas/pee breaks). Second of all, I would welcome larger exterior size if it bought me more legroom (I don't have a need for a wider or taller car, as I have plenty of hip, head, and shoulder room in my sunroof-equipped Accord as it is. The only thing that would make a good thing better in my case is legroom (I have enough to be comfortable, but more spread-out/stretch-out room never hurts at 6'4"", ya know? I didn't know the actual specs on legroom, I was doing more ""wishful thinking"" than anything. I know I'm rambling, but car companies should put more front-seat travel in their seat tracks. I sit with the seat all the way back, and anyone under 6' has plenty of room behind me. I could go an extra inch or two and have a typical 5'4"" person comfortable. I'm regularly driving my friends around (it happens when you've got a roomy car), and extra travel would be appreciated for my guy friends (my three best guy friends are 6'4"" 190, 6'4"" 320, and 6'3"" 250) in the front seat!

Ah, no wonder they don't mention the front leg room specs!

In comparison, the 177"" Elantra has more front leg room and about the same trunk space. I thought Honda was good on intelligent packaging.

How its packaged may make it feel larger than it is.

Louiswei is right. I really did look at other automakers before deciding on my 2006; for me, Honda has two MAJOR things in their pocket - interior quality and ride/handling balance.

For now, having a dealer close by (walking distance, actually), and Honda doing nothing but give me good service (referring to both vehicles and personnel), I don't have a reason not to give them my loyalty.Of course I'll look at other makes each time, but I'm starting with a well-earned Honda bias.

Looks like Honda's done fine on the ride/handling balance for the '08 Accord, but the interior quality could be another story, based on the comment re the quality (or lack thereof) of the base trim's interior. But the higher-end trims seem to have impressive quality. That's too bad if true; one of the great things about getting the Accord DX, VP, or LX in the past is that you were getting basically the same car, interior and all, as in the higher trims (no leather or fancy doo-dads, but the materials were the same). Looks like some de-contenting occuring to keep the price reasonable.I guess I am a dis-loyal car buyer. I buy whatever fits my needs best at the time, for the lowest price. If that's a Honda, I'll gladly buy a Honda such as the Accord. But I'm not going to give Honda or any other manufacturer brownie points because one or more of their cars worked for me in the past. I don't see Honda offering me any financial incentive to be loyal to them--a loyalty rebate, for example. So let the best car, at the best price, win my business. "

Well I guess my Honda Accord V6 may last a good long time, though I am less than impressed with a couple of noises. First the engine got noisy, as in a rubbing sort of sound to the belts after about a couple thousand miles on her. Had it in twice to be repaired. Makes the same sound. Ask the dealership about it again during the last oil change, and the mechanic said it sounds normal. Well it may for a 1970's American V6, but certainly not by Japan, or Honda standards. I may try another dealership. The other noise, which is only heard when things are really quiet, is the right fender which makes a few ticks or creaks sounds when turning the car. You only hear that in a parking lot or entering a driveway. They repositioned the fender. It makes the same sound.The car performs 100% on the road for handling and comfort. The gas mileage is good. Will I buy another one, not sure. The noise thing gives me a little pause. Will see how the car rates over time. Feature wise, I like everything except auto-express down and up windows, which drive me crazy. Oh add the re-locking of doors after you hit the open in about 30 seconds - kinda crazy thing. Now the auto opening of windows before entry is pretty neat idea to cool the car down and is a real plus. Being a person which has owned lots of different cars, some being Japanese, I am kinda tough on rating my car, so at the present time, I am giving it an 85 to 90% due to engine and fender noises. I did have an independent repairman say he thought the engine sounded OK, but then again, he may have listened to lots of rock n' roll over the years, at volume = full. Loren "

For handling, I am thinking Miata again, maybe the second gen, or Bimmer for a little more room, nice engine and roll bars and aggressive look the BMW Z3 is good, but can not match handling. The Solstice has the looks, but no roll bar - not a place to put a roll bar, and it is kinda a bathtub feel to the driving position with those too tall doors.OK back to mid-sized cars. I guess something positive can be said for most all of these cars in this class. They all have something for someone. I may be what is the most important elements to an individual nowadays, more so than the old this is good car, and that one is a bad car, which did make life more simple :blush: For resale, we all know the leaders, so debate there is useless.

In a way, yeah, in 6 years resale value is less important. If you happen to own a Corolla or Civic though, you may be pleasantly surprised at the retained value even in 10 years, with higher miles. They will still buy them, at least in Ca. with high miles and many years. Much harder to sell an old domestic. I still think domestics make a good used car buy, or even a new car buy, if it is something special you really are after, and plan to keep it awhile. Old rule with me was Japan new, Domestics used. Problem is the rule was NOT old enough, and I bought a lot of NEW domestic cars which did not sell well. I must say the Mustang was a good enough trade-in value. Mustangs use to do well -- perhaps still do.L "

I hardly ever sell a car. I think of the 13 cars I've owned only 3 have been re-sold and these were all sold for a few hundred bucks. So resale value has been of little concern for me. It took me about 18 mo. of off and on shopping and research to buy my last car. So if I were to trade every 2-3 years, I'd probably be perpetually working on buying/selling cars. I have never been able to bring myself to buy used, unless it was a cheap car. Most I ever paid for a used car was $3800 in Dec. 2000. Buying a 1-3 year old car and supposedly saving a lot on depreciation sounds good on paper, but I have never gotten the impression that it would work that well in reality...at least for me. Saving in the neighborhood of $4000 to get a car with maybe 20,000-30,000 miles on it, is not enough compensation for going with a used car for me. The idea of buying a higher priced used car from a private seller makes me nervous. "

Where do you park all the cars? Drive a different old car each day? As for used, I would say if bought for 1/2 the original cost, or less, is the way to go for used. American cars are usually the best deals in used. I did find an excellent 6 year old Miata some years back. It was about a third the current Miata price, and had 36K miles on it. Sometimes Japan and German good buys can be found.L "

 I don't see Honda offering me any financial incentive to be loyal to them--a loyalty rebate, for example. So let the best car, at the best price, win my business. It's an unwritten rebate issued as knowing and having peace of mind that your car will never break down or require tow truck services for over 200,000 to 300,000 miles with proper maintenance. The finanicial incentive is that you won't have to spend money on mechanics and replacement parts (I must have spent thousands on MOPAR replacement parts alone).So in order to have your viewpoint and outlook, you have to ignore decades of reliability data. :surprise: "

That is why there is GAP insurance. If someone is upside down on payments (assuming payments are up to date) GAP insurance will pay the difference between the cars value and the loan payoff amount. In CT where I live, state law requires insurance companies to pay RETAIL value (which is better than resale value) when a car is totaled. My 28 month old '05 Sonata is worth about $3500 less than I paid for it in April, '05 according to NADA. That's not a bad depreciation hit at all. Anyone should check with their car insurance company about GAP insurance before buying GAP through the dealer. I'm an insurance agent and have seen hundreds of dollars of saving for my clients by getting insurance company GAP vs dealer GAP. "

It's your $$$, so if you really want the freedom to sell/trade whenever the urge strikes (even if it's less than 3 years) it's the only option. Exactly why I usually lease. I don't keep cars long and I prefer the lower payments that can go with that. I did buy my Mustang after I ""sold"" my leased Mazda6 to the Ford dealer for the amount of the remaining balance on the lease. There were 7 remaining months, out of 36 total, on that Mazda lease so you're not necessarily bound to the length of a lease if you don't want to be. I could have sold it myself too and made a profit but I didn't want the hassle.Lease companies may differ in how they handle those situations but Mazda was very clear in what I could and couldn't do and they made it very easy for the Ford dealer to buy my lease out and therefore own the car. I drove home in the Mustang the very same day I went to look at it. It was that seamless. "

Yes, but if your going to waste the extra money on GAP insurance payments, why not just put aside the payments in a high interest yielding account and pay for the ""gap"" yourself???

One in a million shot? Lesseee now... the last Honda I owned was ""broken down"", i.e. major components inoperable, twice.

Andres, how does $28 per year for an option package offered by one of the insurance companies I represent sound to you? That $28 option includes lease GAP, up to $3,000 rental car, OEM replacement parts until car is 5 model years old, replacement of accidental air bag deployment, $100 lock & key service, plus a couple other things. Would a high interest yielding account pay for any GAP if I front ended the first year's $28 payment if I were upside down on the loan? How much more car would $28 per year for 5 years buy? And, my '05 Sonata GLS SV is no where's near falling apart. It hasn't had to have anything fixed or adjusted. I'd guess that a typical new Honda has decreased in value by at least $3500 in the same 28 month period.You seem to be totally ignorant regarding GAP insurance. GAP insurance does not apply to a car's reliability, it only applies to physical damage claims that ""total"" a car. Actual Cash Value means ""replacement cost less depreciation."" In CT, as I posted earlier, the law defines ""replacement cost"" as ""retail value"" and further specifies that ""NADA"" and one other recognized source's value will be averaged to determine the retail value. These other sources can include KBB retail value or newspaper ads from dealerships for used cars of the same make, year and model of car. "

Let me say this, as a 2-Accord owner who has no problem saying he loves both of his cars...Honda is a large company, just like any other in this forum.Honda makes good cars that please lots of customers, just like any other in this forum.Honda makes its share of mistakes and has its share of issues to work through, just (say it with me) like any other in this forum.Hondas are cars made by imperfect beings, people. Are they typically ahead of the curve on reliability? Many reports say yes. It doesn't make them perfect though; far from it. Let's quit pretending like Honda wears a halo and has only a ""1 in a million"" shot of being a shop. They don't. I have a 1996 Accord that has 175k miles, and has cost relatively little to keep running. I also have a 2006 Accord with 24,100 miles, and it had more problems (2) than my 1996 had in an entire year last year. The problems were minor (a loose interior rear-view mirror and a gas flap that needed some little rubber piece plopped back into place).

The life story of a 1990 Honda Accord EX Automatic, bought brand new by a married couple for the wife to commute to work in.The original owners put 100,000 miles on the car in 9 years before deciding to upgrade. They listed the car for sale privately in 1999, when I purchased it to commute to college in.During my ownership over the next 2.5 years and 40,000 miles, the car did have quite a few moderate problems. Right off the top of my head:-on the drive home, noticed a strange high-pitched scraping noise, turned out to be the distributer-intake manifold became clogged, resulting in increased intake noise and reduced performance; shop had to drill holes-starter solenoid failed; car would not start when interior was hot, had to open doors/hood for it to cool before it would crank-igniter failed; while driving, all power accesories including gauges went dead, car kept running until shut off then wouldn't start again-power door lock module failedI sold this car privately in 2001. Last year, I emailed the third owner and asked her what became of the car. She stated that she drove the car with no major problems until ""well over 200 thousand miles"" but that everything was starting to go at that point, including the transmission. She traded it in to a dealer in 2004, and who knows what happened to it then.So all in all, that car was pretty reliable throughout it's life. Evidently I just had the bad spot, but hey nothing major failed. No engine/tranny rebuilds, etc.Now I bought a brand new Accord.

Once upon a time (it seems like long ago) a mid-size sedan forum would have been dominated by the theme which is best, Ford or Chevy. Now it's Honda and Toyota versus the rest of the field. The more things change, the more they stay the same.There are loyalists -- and detractors -- on both sides of the aisle. It's safe to say, I believe, that Honda and Toyota have built some fine automobiles over the last two decades. I believe it is equally true that the competition has gotten a lot keener in the last five years.In its heyday, the Ford Taurus absolutely dominated the mid-size sedan segment but Ford failed to keep pace with the market and let the Taurus die on the vine.The Fusion is the new Taurus, although the new Taurus is an old Five Hundred and now a full-size sedan. Except for horrific 14.8 mpg in-city gas mileage, our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion has been perfect for nine months and 4,321 miles. Knock on wood.Only time will tell if the Fusion proves to be as reliable as an Accord or Camry. So far, so good. Nary a recall. Not a single rattle, squeak or other malady. I believe Ford has produced a genuine winner in the Fusion, definitely equal to the Accord and Camry but with better styling and handling at a better price.Just my 2 cents worth. "

I'm fully aware GAP has nothing to do with reliability, but covers the amount you owe vs. what your car is worth. GAP ceases to be useful if you stick to cars that have great resale and don't buy with no money down. Cars that have great resale TEND to be, and USUALLY are very reliable, so they are inherently indirectly related. "

I am blown away by the mileage you report though.You are getting similar mileage to a full-size SUV out of a mid-size sedan. I would not be happy with that by any means.Do you expect it to improve? If not why stay in a sedan at all when you can get twice the space with the same mileage in something bigger?The mileage culprit, I believe, is the all-wheel drive and the type of driving, as Allen Kirky noted. Even our 2000 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder, automatic transmission Ford Focus station wagon only averages 17-19 mpg over the same route.But I certainly agree that 14.8 mpg is the pits for a mid-size sedan. It does yield 24-24 mpg on trips however and the revised EPA estimate for this drive train is 17 mpg city and 24 mpg highway.We really like everything about the vehicle except for the poor gas mileage. If I'd had any inkling whatsoever that the mileage was going to be this bad I would have bought something else.A mid-size sedan is plenty large enough for our purposes (and most people's). In retrospect, a 4-cylinder engine would have been a better choice. It might not have equaled the EPA estimate in our driving circumstances but it would certainly do better than the 14.8 we are constantly getting.Since we have 4,300 miles on the car, I don't expect any improvement either. It's a bitter pill but it is still a fine automobile otherwise. "

If I'd had any inkling whatsoever that the mileage was going to be this bad...Well...sorry, but I'd have to say that getting 17-19 mpg in a 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder, automatic transmission Ford Focus station wagon should have given you more than an inkling of what to expect in a V6 AWD Fusion. Your Focus Wagon would have had about 26 city listed on the sticker and you were getting 17-19. The Fusion had 19 city on the sticker, you should reasonably have expected to get 7-9 mpg less or alternatively you should have expected about 70% of that figure, based on your Focus. Those expectations would have led you to expect maybe 13 mpg at best. You should be actually be happy that your Fusion is doing better than the Focus relative to its EPA rating "

I would concur that Ford engines historically may not be as fuel efficient as others, but . . . I just spent 5 days and 1,400 miles in brand new 2008 Taurus (aka old Five Hundred, and yes, it was a Hertz rental) with the new 3.5L DOHC V6, and 6-speed automatic. 85% highway and 15% city with the trunk and backseat loaded with tradeshow material for my business trip. Combined mileage was 28.8MPG - not bad for such a large and heavy car. And, I didn't drive 65 on the highway either - typically 70 to 80, with a couple of blasts far above either. How far on a practically uninhabited interstate in KY, I won't say, but suffice to say Ford's new 3.5L DOHC V6 has some serious get up and go, unlike the old 3.0L Duratec. "

There is a new rumor that the 09 Fusion will get the 3.5L V6 after all, which sounds like a change from the original plans for only a revised 3.0L V6. Looking at 2008 EPA numbers:2008 Taurus 18/282008 Accord V6 18/292008 Camry V6 19/28Given that the Fusion is 340 lbs lighter than the Taurus and assuming it does get the 3.5L V6 I would expect it to get at least 18/28 or possibly 19/29. With 268 HP this would put the Fusion on a level playing field again. And if more hp becomes necessary, Ford will have a 3.7L version and direct injection available.Of course only Ford has AWD to enable that much power to reach the ground without massive torque steer so I don't see how the Camcords could handle 300 hp even if it was available.

With a number of assumptions in the case of Honda and Toyota, they come up with the following warranty costs per unit at your link:That would imply that Toyota is paying around $265 per vehicle in warranty claims and Honda is paying out around $330 per automobile. That's considerably less than Ford's $585 or GM's $512, not to mention DaimlerChrysler's $1,370 per vehicle. Taking Ford vs. Honda, assuming the difference is spread over the three year warranty period this comes to an $85 per year difference. BTW, this is in the same balpark as the ~$50 difference in repair costs that edmunds estimates for year 5 in their true cost to own figures for Accord vs. Fusion.Cost differences of under $100 per year are not enough for me to choose one vehicle over another. I'd might want to stay away from Chysler based on this information, though...but they had nothing of interest (to me) to begin with anyway.(Note to Andre...Honda's figure is not $0 :surprise: ) "

While I don't doubt for a minute that overall Toyota produces more reliable vehicles than GM, it's hard to compare these numbers due to vehicle mix. I'd bet GM's trucks and SUVs are more expensive to warranty than a Yaris or Camry. It would be interesting to see what the warranty costs are on each model line. One model with a huge quality problem can throw the whole thing off, like what happened to Ford a few years ago with the Powerstroke diesel that I believe cost them over a $1billion alone in warranty costs.

My Contour with the 2.5l duratec and MTX75 would get 26-27 in mixed driving, slightly better than the EPA estimates.

To help even the mix a little, I'll tell when I've had to have it towed.Once, and it was the dealer's fault.In June, I had a hairline crack in the top of the radiator. I had the radiator replaced, without it ever overheating on me; never leaving me stranded.The dealer didn't clamp the hose tightly on the bottom of the radiator, however, and it came loose, losing all of its coolant. Luckily, I saw the temp gauge rising, got to the shoulder (fun at 4PM on a workday in 95-degree heat), and called the dealer. Since the work had just been done two days prior, they sent a tow truck and a service representative to drive me behind the tow truck back to the dealer. In truth, they ought to be glad I saved their butts. If I had kept driving, the car would've overheated and blown the head gasket, and they'd be the one covering the repair. Instead, they had a $80 towing bill to cover, and that was it.This was with about 173,000 miles on my 1996 Accord LX 4-cylinder.So, yes, I was towed once, but it was indirectly the car's fault (I pay enough attention to my car to as to catch problems before they leave me stranded, such as seeing the radiator crack and the small leak that was getting larger).

One question: how many times have you called a tow truck in to move your Hondas? It is a myth that folks who drive anything but hondas or Toyotas are constantly getting towed and/or ""stranded"". That sort of thing just does not happen much with any car. I had a 1986 Horizon for 12 years and 120,000 miles never towed, never stranded. Same with a 1989 Plymouth Voyager also in 12 years 120K mi. 1997 Windstar that is still in the family, is at 10 years 110 K mi also never towed/stranded. A 1996 Contour was towed twice after I had given it away to my son. Once was due to broken timing belt at 106 K mi or so, this occured 3 blocks from home. This was not unexpected and was really more due to what could be considered to be deferring maintenance as long as possible. The second tow was when it was totaled in an accident at about 112K. After 1995 Contour was given to my daughter it had radiator explode with about 140K mi and she was stranded and towed.So in 20 years and about 450,000 total miles with American makes (the contours were bought used, so I am only counting the miles during the time we owned them) there is a total of one tow/stranding that was not due to accident or deferred maintenance.

2) Since when has the Malibu been a real deal competitor; that should answer your question.Well, the new Malibu will be different from past Malibus, so no, it really doesn't. I'm not the forum police, just trying to look for a constructive way to get off the shameless Honda is perfect praise. If a Malibu can beat a Camry in a comparison test (this is the current model that beat the last-gen Camry back in 2004), thaen I would say the Malibu has been competitive for a while now. The Camry is a best-seller, and a prominent magazine rated the Malibu higher, so, yeah, its competitive. I was asking about the new one with the 3.6L engine, much more stylish interior, etc... But instead it went back to bashing the domestic *sigh :sick: I tried. "

Yes, Malibu will have a 170 hp Ecotec and also a (mild) hybrid option--said to be the lowest-priced hybrid yet. And come next March, the I4 will have a 6-speed AT (comes out of the gate with just a 4 speed). And it's (dare I say) a looker--IMO much better looking than Camry or Accord. I see a lot of Auras on the road, and Chevy has a much bigger dealer network, so if the Malibu is at least on a par with the Aura, sales should be brisk. "

Your list of the top three MUST-HAVE features in your new midsize car, besides the obvious A/C, Stereo, PW/PL etc... and what model fits your needs best? Which ones needs work? 1. Safety - both active and passive. That would mean at least six airbags, active head restraints, good IIHS crash test scores, ABS, and ESC.2. Comfortable and flexible driving position. As Leslie Nielsen said in Police Squad (or one of its sequels maybe), ""A guy's gotta be comfortable!"" That means a multi-adjustable seat with dual (or power) height adjuster, a telescopic wheel, and ideally an adjustable lumbar support.3. Smooth, compliant, quiet ride without being mushy. I drive on the pot-holed highways and byways of Minnesnowta most of the time. 'Nuff said?I haven't driven the new Accord yet (well, very few people have, right?), nor the new Malibu, nor even the Altima. Right now, there isn't a single mid-sized car that meets all of these criteria. The Legacy comes closest, but is pricey, the ride is a little too firm for my taste, and it has too small a back seat for my needs (that would be #4 on the list). If the Optima gets a ""Good"" on the IIHS side crash test, it will move to the top of my list for mid-sized sedans. At least until I drive the Accord, Malibu, Altima, 2009 Mazda6... Another intriguing option for me, assuming it scores a ""Good"" on the IIHS side test, is the Elantra SE. It's mid-sized where it counts (inside) but compact outside (and in price). But is well-equipped including standard ESC, has comfortable seating front and rear, and a smooth ride with decent handling. The Versa is another compact with mid-sized room, but it doesn't offer ESC. Otherwise it's high on my list; it's one of the few low-priced cars (Civic is another) that aced the IIHS tests. "

Well the Aura XR would have sold better had they not watered down the V6 image for the Aura in the first place with the XE 3.5 V6. This two flavors of engine and transmissions became a distraction for the Aura as seen as the really cool Euro - American car to compete with the likes of say the V6 Camry, Altima and Accord. But oh no, here we go with the old, we'll give you six cylinders for the price of four cylinders, with an old four speed tranny. Then we also have this other version, which looks the same on the outside, but oh boy, she is a new gal inside, with the 3.6 V6 and a 6 speed paddle shiften' selector and that good stuff. Now they are going with an i4 engine in the Aura and a hybrid, with not all that much different performance to further confuse the buying public. NO- the Aura should have be top line only. Let the New Malibu to the rest. But then again, we have the first ever G6, Aura and Malibu, along with the pricey Saab, all sharing this platform. Ah it won't stop there, perhaps a Caddy is on the way, or what the heck, a Buick or GMC truck (just kidding) in this platform. To me, the New Malibu is a slight exterior change to Aura, with a cooler looking interior, while the G6 is less interesting looking of the three sedans. Wouldn't mind a Saab 9-3 for say $25K  And in the end, all will be good to good enough, but nothing to write home about. Yeah, I know, award winning and all that jazz. Good car, leave it at that. The Impala and Camaro are the next shots they need to take to score the big one. L "

The Aura does look good, but I have to wonder what GW was thinking with that VW looking rear end on the new Malibu. Overall the new Malibu looks rather bland from the front, awful from the rear and just ok from a side angle. The Aura is certainly leagues better in the styling department. They should have stuck with the concept styling seen previously, the final incarnation is quite a disappointment.Interior of the Malibu, now that looks a lot better than its outer skin, and more stylish than the Aura.

Malibu Classic is not too far off from what the New Malibu is going to be style wise. What they needed in that first, not so bad looking effort, is now going to be available. Better handling and drive-train arrives on the scene. I hope the emergency brake is a hand brake type, and that the car eeks out another inch or two on the inside space -- more narrow center of dash, if not anything else. Hope it has gas props for the hood. Seems like it could be a decent car -- good car. Should play well against the competition in the mid-sized FWD car class. Now Toyota has the time to change the interior on the 2008, so one wonders if an improvement is in the works? What about the transmissions on the Camry? If they are A-OK for 2008, yet another problem for New Malibu efforts for the old knock-out punch. Will the new super-sized Accord be a hit. American seem to like super-sized everything. New look could be a hit too. With so many good cars in the competition, from Aura to Milans who knows the ultimate fate of yet another good car? Is the Altima going to remain fairly hot? What happened to Sonata? Looks like it is half fleet sales. Oh wait, this means soon there will be very-very inexpensive cars in this class flooding the market. Folks, this is one tough game!ya wonder?Loren "

Off topic due to size of vehicle but relevent due to the fact it IS a Honda. I originally had a small right rear suspension clunk (from new @ 5 miles showing) that only got worse until last July with about 4K miles showing it was terrible. Upon returning to the selling dealer and after a short test ride with a tech. it was evident to both of us (actually it was evident to me for a long time) I had some sort of problem. They took the car in, placed it on a lift, and five minutes later I was informed that not only was the right rear shock completely dry..all the fluid had leaked out BUT the left side was leaking too. So, both rear shocks were replaced at 4K miles. As I type there is a front driver seat, bottom cushion cover (the seat fabric) awaiting me to make an appointment to be replaced due to the roughly 4 inch X 3 inch patch where the fabric pattern has all but worn off. The fabric has not worn through but the ""squiggly lines"" that are the pattern on the EX sedan we own are mostly gone within that area. This is addition to several Honda ""service bulletins"" I have had to avail myself of to correct odd noises. There is one (#06-060)that they (Honda) won't apply because the noise ""cannot be duplicated"" even though on the drive home from that attempt I heard it several times..bad for me!! Car currently has 10,050 miles showing. This was our first Honda product so you see I am not entirely in agreement with the notion from you or anyone else posting here that Honda is ""God's own ride"" "

I used to be very brand loyal if I had a good experience with a product, but now, I've had good experiences with many different brands, so I don't care as much as what characteristics a product has and it's relative value. I do pay attention to what Consumer Reports and Jd Power says in their reliability ratings to get an idea of how things hold up. And both of these sources of info indicate that the differences in the amount of problems a car in this class have over a five year period is very minor (usually less than 1 extra problem over a 5 year period, which to me is not as significant as say hauling capability or better handling). Given that there are two different sources that have come up with similar reliability ratings, I find that I can now choose what I like rather than feeling any sense of loyalty to a brand. I mean, why should I be loyal to someone I give money to... I'll let companies who innovate and engineer good features for a fair price get the money I earn. Who that company will be is up to them... let them fight for my dollars by constantly improving their product! "

From what I have read over the last couple years, the Speed6 was selling at $7-8K discounts from MSRP most of the time and Mazda6 probably available at anywhere from $4-6K off MSRP.Anyway since Accords do not depreciate, should be easy enough to correct your error  and trade that Accord for a 6 or speed6  .

Saturn Aura represents a new direction for Saturn. It is in total a new car for Saturn, and the little plastic unique cars are replaced by GM basic design, or the Epsilon for everyone car. It is a good sound car. Why not just call it an Opel, who knows. The more interesting stuff come to us in a couple years as the Impala and Camaro. How good are the Aussie cars for reliability and performance -- anyone here know. It is basically the new stuff. The New CTS to me personally is a wait and see. I am not wanting any of these cars to grow, be a CTS or Accord, but that is life. We are all super-sized now from McD's to autos.I personally see the Epsilon, in its many flavors as competing with the rest, and winning some hearts along the way. The Aura XR is entertaining to drive. I do not expect it change the game completly however, as it is doubtful to have the same resale value as brand X from Japan, and the reliability being equal or better is a question mark. Don't know what to say other than I guess one could sort of judge reliablity performance by that of G6, as it has been released earlier and has some miles of actual use now. So when the new Consumer Report comes out, we have a couple or so years to go by. As for giant leaps, the RWD from Down Under still look to have the most impact. If they do not get the Impala and all those Pontiacs right, all hell may break in the press. I understand many are impressed with the Sky and Solstice.

Although these cars did not change overnight, they did change and for the better. I remember when Hondas were first brought to the US. They were really pieces of junk and you could see the rust bubbling under the paint after three or four years. The sheet metal was about as thin as a tuna can. I had a 1973 Toyota Corona which I kept for only one year as it was impossible to get the idle right. It had to be set so high to keep running with the air conditioner on that when you turned off the air conditioner it would be close to 2,000 rpms. Turn the air on and it would drop down to about 800 rpms. Several dealers could not fix so I got rid of it and took a beating. Now look at where Honda and Toyota are. Granted, it certainly wasn't a quick turnaround but slow but sure. I personally think that the domestics can come around if enough effort is put forth and consumers keep open minds and don't mindlessly follow the leaders. "

Gets as good mileage as my 4 cylinder Optima-- 33 mpg on the road-- 22 around town, lighter and lower than an ohc engine, 7000 mile indicated oil changes on the OLM, unlike Japanese (and Korean) cars it's real world mileage approached the old epa figures (most GM cars didn't have the drops from 07-08 that Japanese cars did). True, it's noisier and thrashier at higher rpms but low end torque is good and I don't get that far up on the tach anyway.I think GM finally got tired of the tirades of the likes of Car and Driver constantly putting them down. RIP-- OHV engines, you will be missed. The last gen 'Bu sedan was unremarkable, but I didn't mind the back clip on the Maxx (won't defend the front). I'm sure that the new Malibu is better in every way but I'll miss the hatch and find the new one looks disconcertingly like a Mitsubishi Diamante from the rear. "

What makes you think, or state here, that Japan and Korean cars do not match or exceed the EPA fuel figures? I have no problem doing so with a new V6 Accord. I have gotten up to 29 MPG and will likely do better once broken in. Let's see a 200-300K mile engine, the break in must be at 50K  And I do not drive conservative to get the MPG, this is brisk off the line and good speed on the freeways. At 60 or 70, the SOHC is good to go faster with ease, and not throw a fit in doing so. Just smooth and sweet sounds coming under the full on acceleration period. And yes, the 3.5 OHV is perhaps the best V6 of its type I have seen. I am impressed with it in some ways. Good torque. Once up to speed, and in need of more speed, as in passing at higher speeds, I'll still take the Honda engine. Or the DOHC 3.6 of GM, which is great. Something about the way the Hondas like to rev. Well, this is my first Honda car, but I owned a Honda 70SL and 100 bike some time ago. OK, a long time a go, gosh I feel so old.I could live with the 3.5 OHV engine in a car. I tested a G6 and did not like the electric assist steering. The engine was the 3.5 mated to a four speed. Test drove the Aura XE with that combo. It is OK. The XR is so much better though performance wise. For sound, I like the OHC engines in the V6, but I guess I never got a catback muffler by Borla on any of my OHV V6 engined cars from GM I owned. They all just made that blurping funny sound on launch time.L "

I read today in the C/D 2008 preview that the Aura will come with an I4 for 2008. I think that's good news, as not everyone who is looking for a mid-sized sedan wants/needs a V6 (I'm one of them). It should also drop the Aura below $20k and make it price-competitive (at least MSRP) with the Korean 4-bangers.Speaking of which, I noticed today that with current incentives and a discount down to invoice, a very well equipped Optima LX can be had for around $15k. So the new Accord looks really good... but is it $7000+ better than an Optima? "

Well I bought an '07 Accord SE V6 for around $22.5K, some months ago. I assume it can be had for less right now. Have no idea what the Accord i4 then would be priced at, but let's guess it to be currently around $19K for the SE i4, or less? Considering you are getting a Honda compared to a Kia and the resale should be about double that of the Kia in five to ten years time, I would say the bargain goes to the Honda. If you keep the Optima until death (of the car) or ten years time, the Kia is a pretty good deal indeed.

When I said ""the new Accord"", I meant the 2008 Accord. Good luck getting any incentives or even much of a discount on the new Accord for awhile. That means the base LX will start at, by published reports, about $21k. Add automatic, 17"" alloys, and upgraded interior trim (ala Optima LX with the appearance package and ESC package) and you are probably looking at $23k at least for an Accord I4 equipped like that. So I was probably being optimistic when I said a $7000 difference--probably will be more than that, at least for the next few months while all the ""gotta-have-a-2008-Accord"" buyers are satiated.Resale of an Accord double that of an Optima in 10 years' time? Maybe. As in, something like $2500 vs. $5000. You'd still be up several thousand bucks with the Optima. And I didn't even include the extra taxes or interest charges on the Accord. No, the bargain clearly goes to the Optima. But if you gotta have that extra power, or spiffy interior (although the Optima's interior is pretty darn nice too), or all the Hondaness (don't know what else to call it), or extras like factory nav, and you don't have a better way to use the extra bucks, go for it!

Don't know about the Optima, but the Sonata, IMHO, is a good car, but not up there at the top. The steering, handling, suspension, engine, interior, and such are 85% to perhaps 90% there, but not quite the same as the top competitors. The car doesn't handle and drive like a Honda V6. Anyway, just go get an '07 SE V6 for around $22K, or the i4 for much less money. I would say the i4 16"" wheels are more than large enough for the i4 engine version. Why would you want the 17""? And the interior of the SE i4 is very nice. Then there is the Altima. I would wait for Camry until 2008 or 2009 to be sure bugs are not remaining. If looking at price only, the Korean cars do have price, with good performance, if perhaps not top line just yet. It all sorta equals out, and depends on what ya want from a car. The Aura XR is pretty cool, but the price is a bit much, if looking for the value overall type of thing, as in the price in/out. Just a sweet engine and tranny in the thing.Isn't Optima the name of Radio Shack audio upper line products, after the Realistic name ( maybe it replaced it? )You could nickname the car Opie !

Have you researched the Optima? You might be surprised. The automotive press' consensus is that it's a better car than the Sonata, at least in I4 trim. It has received strong reviews from MT (a 2007 COTY finalist), C/D (ranked just below the Accord and new Altima in the last mid-sizer comparo, with the comment that it out-Toyota'd the Camry; and CR has it (the I4) ranked above the Sonata (and the Camry LE, and Legacy, and Mazda6, and Fusion/Milan etc.) and one point behind the Accord. It handles better than the Sonata, has a nicer interior, has a 5AT vs. the 4AT on the Sonata I4s, and is shorter than the Sonata yet has almost as much interior room.So while the Optima is not seen as being the best of the class, it is viewed as being a very good mid-sized sedan and superior to some cars that are seen as standards in this class, e.g. the Camry. And of course it has the long Kia warranty. That makes it an intriguing buy for someone who doesn't mind paying about $7000 or more less for a car that doesn't have every attribute of an Accord or Altima, but is a solid, well-rounded mid-sized car.

I would say the i4 16"" wheels are more than large enough for the i4 engine version. Why would you want the 17""? Wheel size diameter is an aesthetics issue, for the most part. The only time its not is when companies put random obscure tire sizes like 205/60R16 on their vehicles to crush any hopes of actually finding any kind of a performance tire. Most other vehicles use a 205/55R16 that can be found in types from mild to wild. "

Taking off the differences that should figure in at mid-fourteens for a base LS with automatic. We shopped the Fusion/Milan and Sonata four most carefully before buyingFriend just bought a Sonata, not sure what he paid as he had two cars to trade and he might not be as frugal as I am in driving a bargain. Just drove his car for a few blocks and it seems more comfortable. Frankly I'd prefer the Sonata (short drive) and last gen Malibu Maxx (my personal drive) when it comes to comfort. My wife doesn't mind the Optima a bit for comfort but I'm roughly a foot taller. The Optima is only about a cubic foot smaller than the Sonata but it has more headroom. Who needs eight inches of above the head room if five inches is adequate. More important to get the leg room. The Optima's platform is closer to the Elantra than a Sonata (struts v. links), but seems sportier in handling (not important to me)-- this is probably my 17 inch Michelins v. his 16 inch Michelin Energies (from experience Energies are lousy oem tires at least in my 01 Elantra). As far as the GM electric steering. It's part of the reason why GM cars got good gas mileage. Vagueness and expensive repairs were negatives. I don't mind the GM steering at all but can notice it after I drive the Optima. Same thing with the engine. Doesn't bother me but the Optima's four is smoother and revs better than the Malibu's six (which does get as good mileage), so if I was doing short term comparisons it would bother me. I haven't done a careful check but I think GM cars 08 EPA estimated mileages v. 07 has gone down less than the typical GM car. Now maybe somebody can do the research and prove me right or wrong on this. "

But then again, you become one with the car and just can do it in your head after a few months time.

You may want to test drive a V6 SE Accord some day on a twisty road. And it has very good passing speed and a good launch off the line. Interior is first class.

This has resulted in the Accord being far less ahead of the curve than it was twenty years ago (Camry was always well done but conservative), but you can't blame Honda for doing what's in their financial interest.This doesn't apply to the present generation Civic which is a big change and (could be argued) quite daring.

As an added benefit, we can actually find our car in the parking lot.

With the Civic having a higher EPA average than the Fit, and the Accord I4s with good numbers, I really don't think they need the Fit's numbers.There could also simply be a plant capacity problem with the Fit, since it's sold around the world. The new U.S. plant will help there.But, back to mid-sized sedans...  "

Well it is higher quality. The Sonata is, like you say a cheaper car than is the Accord. No one is going to give away a car which identical to the top cars available at a fraction of the price. You know, the old if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. And take a look at what Intellichoice has to say on the different cars. Pay a little more up front, have the top line stuff, then trade-in or sell the car for a higher price -- which one is the bargain at that point? L "

In this segment, cookie-cutter is the norm. Actually depending on where one lives car-x can be cookie cutter and be very high-end. in certain parts of the country Rolls-Royce are cookie-cutter cars, but I digress.I honestly don't care how many of the brand of car I drive are on the road. Bro-in-law who does much more extensive research than me when buying a car, just ended up with a basic Accord. The reasons? They are the same reasons I would buy one over the competition.

Intellichoice is very flawed. They ignore rebates in calculating costs, this overstates the costs of any car which commonly has a rebate available. They also ignore the value of discounted or free financing, when that is available. For example the Mazda6 has been available with $1750-$2000 rebates since Nov 2006. Intellichoice ignores this and shows a phoney ~$2000 difference in depreciation between Accord and Mazda6.I also found some flaws in their maintenance costs. For example on my car, Mazda6, their detailed maintenance costs mistakenly indicate that it does not have extended life coolant and does not have extended life trans fluid. They also project tire replacement cost at about $80 more than an Accord, I am pretty sure I can get the same tire price whether they are being put on an Accord or a Mazda6.Their insurance costs also have nothing to do with my reality. My insurance costs vary little, whatever model I choose and are far lower (about 1/3) than what they list. At most my insurance cost, from one model to another, might vary by maybe $200 or so over 5 years.I am not as familiar with the Sonata, but I bet the intellichoice figures are just as full of errors for that car.

Explain to me how I end up buying a Mazda6 at a few nundred above invoice, when there is a $1750 rebate?

Your '92 Accord must have been in exceptional condition to get that much for it, correct? I'll bet you could get at least $2000 for another brand, e.g. Mazda 626. But what if the 626 cost, say, $5000 less than the Accord (that is about today's differential). Compounded over 12 years at 5% interest, that's nearly $9000. Not including any extra sales taxes, which in some states would add several hundred bucks onto the original cost. So you really didn't come out ahead financially with the Accord. But so what? If that were your goal, you probably wouldn't have chosen the Accord to begin with, right? You enjoyed the Accord for those 12 years, and that was worth something to you. "

Well in California there is a difference between a Mazda6 and Accord both new and used in trying to sell them. They have to deep discount to move the Mazda6 out. Used they sell for less. When buying, I took the ""Price everyone is paying as per Intellichoice"" to the Honda dealership and go that price on my SE V6 , plus they gave me what I wanted on the PT Crusier trade in. I can not recall the exact difference on the trade-in, but it was between the $1,200 to $1,500 range on trade-in price and discounts, as being higher to get the Aura XR which is an equal price wise to the SE V6 Accord. Saturn went lower on the car by, but had a low trade-in allowance. I did not price the Mazda6 to buy. Did see some on a lot for $5K off sticker which made them $22K. Overpriced, then discounted means nothing. They had too much dust on the hood. You can get the Accord back then for $22.5K and it has the good resale value. BTW, the New Miata is hot, if it was not for a too narrow seats in the car.L "

That had to be one exceptional shape '92. I like Hondas and their reputation. It's just that I liked the way the Mazda drove better and the features for price equation. Honestly, I realize I might have a couple more issues and maybe a few hundred dollars more in cost over the lifetime of the vehicle. But, I wanted a fairly inexpensive third vehicle and something fun to drive. I really like features I got with the Mazda for $16500 like all disc brakes, 17"" alloys, 6 disc changer, both front windows that down/up auto(a feature that I didn't realize I would appreciate so much) and the overall looks of the car among other things.

 I'll bet you could get at least $2000 for another brand, e.g. Mazda 626.Considering Mazda's average reliability, I think I would have had more problems with the 626, and probably wouldn't have wanted to keep it for 12 years, Which would defeat the purpose of saving money up front. And I don't believe a Mazda 6 equipped like the EX-L V6 Accord would be $5000 less. You make it sound like you can get $5000 off MSRP on a 6, but nothing off on an Accord, which is just not true. I got $3000 off MSRP in 03, which was the first year of the redesign. I'm sure I could do better on an 07 Accord right now. "

Last Mazda6 cars I looked at cost more or the same as the Accord, since the initial price was so jacked up. Seems like a really good car in some ways, and one can say they have the top rated car for handling within its class with the Mazda6, so it certainly is not a bad choice in many ways. The $1,500 to $2,000 off sticker is easy to do on Honda close out Accords right now. Plenty of dealerships, if at first ya don't succeed. As for reliability, there is nothing certain in life. Lot's of owners do seem very happy with Mazda, including durability, so who knows. All the cars are getting better these days.

Any car in good condition has value after 10+ years. The value is in line with the initial sales price--but it never goes to zero, for a car in good condition.It is often said that you don't get something for nothing. So doesn't it seem odd that an Accord buyer should expect to get the benefits often associated with an Accord, e.g. superior reliability, resale value, and driving experience, at no extra cost? Of course there is a cost. But you have to weigh it against the benefits received. "

I have 175k miles on my 1996 Accord. Original transmission, alternator, even original brake shoes on the rears. This car has had oil changes every 3k miles, major maintenance done every 30k miles, and a timing belt at 88k miles (it'll need one at 178k).I'd probably ask $4900 for it (just based on my friend getting calls for $4,000 on his 2 year older and 25k extra mileage car). I might get $4,000, maybe $4,500. Depends on the particular person seeing my ad.Would I buy this car if I were you? Heck no. I wouldn't spend that kind of money when I didn't know the person who had driven it for THAT long. It could've been run for 15k miles between oil changes; nearly overheated a few times, and have a problem eating tires. It could also be in great running condition, with most of its life on the highway getting nearly 30 MPG. At this age though, the question mark would be too big to plop down $5k though, for me.It does make me happy that there ARE people willing to buy these cars, though. I have one. I just wouldn't be the person buying from me. Does that make sense?To be 12 years old this Nov. and have 175k miles, I think this car looks pretty dang good though (this is mine).

I'd say KBB is VERY optimistic.  Edmunds' TMV for a 2002 Civic EX 4-door (the most expensive Civic trim for 2002) with 115k miles in clean condition is only $7740. By that number, in about five years you've lost nearly 50% of the car's value compared to what you paid for it. Which is pretty good! In comparision, I had a similar experience with my '01 Elantra, which I sold last year after 5-1/2 years of ownership, for $5900--exactly 50% of its original purchase price. So you and I both lost about 50% of our original investment over about five years (assuming Edmunds' TMV figures are closer to the real world, which I have found over time they usually are--for example, their TMV for my Elantra at the time I sold it was $5950.). However, my loss was $5900, and yours (on paper) is over $7000. I point this out only as a caution, that resale value percentages don't tell the whole story.An example closer to this discussion (although my Elantra was classed as a mid-sized car based on interior room): this goes back to the 12-year old Accord (a '92) that was sold for $5000. Here's a comparison of 12-year old mid-sized cars, a 1995 Accord EX-V6 and a Mazda 626 ES-V6, each with low miles (120,000) and in outstanding condition; for private party sale, according to Edmunds' TMVs:Accord: $3783626: $1675Note that this is for a V6 Accord (not available in '92), and it's three years after the '92, so some price appreciation should have occured. If this is a representative average for sales prices (with some people doing better and some not as well), then the Mazda buyer would need to have paid at least $1200 less up front than the Accord buyer to come out ahead financially on the purchase in 12 years, assuming an interest rate of 5% compounded annually.The purpose of this rather lengthy example is to demonstrate that it doesn't take a huge difference in price to make up the resale value between an Accord and other makes over a long period of time. And consider now that the price difference between an Accord, even the leftover 2007 models, is several thousand dollars compared to cars like the Fusion/Milan, Mazda6, Optima, and Sonata.Thus, if you plan to own your mid-sized car for a long time and think you can save money in the long run due to a car's historically high resale value, it might be something to re-consider.

Although I have been lurking in this forum for quite a while and frankly have read posts that have gotten me livid, I had to respond this time. It should be noted that information concerning Mazda's putative 'average' reliability, which unfortunately is bandied about here and elsewhere, is sheer conjecture at best or frequently garnered via debatable methodology. For every 'survey' which claims that Honda and Toyota produce vehicles that are intrinsically more 'reliable', there are others that report diametrically-opposite findings. Despite the fact that I have seen (in action) an Accord with an utterly-flawed automatic transmission (and I know that this particular problem is pervasive but obviously not universal across the line) and read about Toyota's 'sludge' problem, among other issues, many still choose to reify the products of these two companies with scant problematization. More troubling is the implicit assumption that if you do not purchase the Accord or Camry, and I am not accusing anyone here of this 'crime', you are bereft of common sense and intelligence, and somehow are 'stuck' with a car that is devoid of the exaggerated (in my humble opinion, at least) 'merits' of a Camry or an Accord.Regarding the much-maligned 626, we have got one in my family that is 7+ years old and is still running beautifully, thank you very much. For the record, I really have got my own idiosyncratic qualms regarding the Accord and Camry. As such, I personally will NOT buy either one and this most certainly is my prerogative; people can choose to procure whatever they wish and do not require the validation of others. "

Despite this intellichoice shows both of them with target price of a few hundred above invoice. This equates to maybe a $1000 error for the Accord, but about a $3000 error for the Mazda6.This would mean the depreciation cost difference between the Mazda6 and the Accord is overstated by about $2000.

All,Concerning the ""average"" reliability of the Mazda 626...I think these ratings for all cars should be broken down by engine/transmission options, as in most cases the really major problems are limited to just one of these.Case in point: The different engine/transmission combinations available on 1998-2002 626's made some of these cars well below average and some well above average in terms of reliability; unfortunately, all that is ever reported is the overall ""average"" for all 626's. The Mazda 2.0L I4 matched with the Ford-sourced automatic transmission was plagued with problems. The transmissions required frequent re-builds/replacement, as often as every 30k. On the other hand, the Ford-sourced (Mazda re-worked) 2.5L V6 paired with the Mazda 5-speed manual was an exceptionally reliable (and entertaining) combination. I know, I had one with over 100k. (Note: that V6 5-speed Mazda with 100k sold for over KBB) "

On my 1998 Mazda 626, my mechanic pointed out to me that many of the electronic parts were interchangeable with Ford. This was evidenced by two distinctly different cable connection types present under the hood (one style for the Mazda parts and one style for the Ford parts).Shoot, I even remember one part having the red three-point Mitsubishi logo...

Why do folks here have to defend their Camcord purchases? Can't they just like them better than the others? Not everybody calculates the minute financial ramifications involved with every purchase. Personally I don't care for half the vehicles in this comparo, so no matter what their attributes are that you would use to persuade me to buy one, I just wouldn't buy one. Period.I spent the day in an indoor Ford dealership yesterday, hanging with a friend buying an F150, and I wouldn't have given you half of what the stickers on those vehicles asked. Ford plasticland. I'll stick with Hondas. "

The idea that because a car is discounted when it's new would make a used, high mileage car hard to sell isn't necessarily true. My old subaru I sold last year after buying the Mazda6 was a 94 legacy gt with 150k miles on it. There were a few dings on the outside, and a couple probs with the cloth in the interior. After buying the 6, I put an ad in Craigslist for $5k (a little less than KBB's private party value) and sold it that day for cash! I think I got a bit lucky at how quickly it sold, but the point is that there are other cars that hold their value and sell well besides just accords. And at the time I sold my Legacy, those were going for 5K off of MSRP for new ones (at least the ones that were left - I bought mine in late november when the next year's models were on the lot). Anyways, sometimes when cars less commonly sold that have pretty steep discounts can hold their value suprisingly well. "

Ford's global platform structure may be irrelevant. I've had many independent service techs tell me Mazda parts are more expensive and harder to get.It would seem that mazda's parts do cost less. In the last IIHS fender bender test, the mazda was one of the least expensive to repair. "

but the point is that there are other cars that hold their value and sell well besides just accords.My point wasn't to say that it was just Accords. It just happened to be that my friend has an Accord to sell, and i have two of them. I don't have experience with selling back another brand of vehicle, so I wouldn't dare say otherwise. All I am doing is speaking about what i know, and that is the good resale of Accords; not poor resale of others. I can't make a solid statement about something I've never experienced firsthand, now can I? My original post about my friend's Accord got a lot of heat. I wasn't trying to impart one car's superiority; just that the Accord does have good resale. It wasn't a comparison, a put-down to others. Folks, we shouldn't have to be so dang defensive around here. Not with me, anyways. (this isn't directed at you specifically zzzoom6).Some long-time posters I sort-of ""converse"" with (elroy5, tallman, backy, among countless others) will tell you I'm typically pretty straightforward when I bring information to the table.

or is he saying that selling a legacy for as much as an accord is as likely as getting struck by lightning? Or maybe he's saying that selling my car quickly was improbable. or maybe he was saying that my mazda6 will not sell for as much as an accord in 10 years... only he knows what his cryptic (and supposedly sly) comment means exactly. Actually, in our neck of the woods, subaru sells quite well and has a good reputation. In fact after doing more research after selling it (I know, doesn't make a lot of sense to research after I sold it but just wanted to know if I did ok or not), asking price at stealerships was higher for models w/ a smaller engine than what I sold. And the people who bought mine said that mine was in much better condition than what they found elsewhere. Retail price on KBB was around 6k while private party was about 5.4k. I think trade in value was in the high 4k range. So all in all, I probably could have gotten more, but it was nice to be able to sell it so quickly and not have an extra car clogging up the garage.Funny thing was, when I got my Mazda6, I wanted to trade in my Subie and was willing to take anything more than 4k, but they wanted nothing to do with it.

I doubt anyone here has been going to car lots looking to trade in their newer midsize sedan looking for cars w/ over 150k miles on them! And I think your 5:1 ratio is generous to Mazda... cars w/ 150k miles on them would on average be around 10 years old, and Mazda was almost bankrupt then b/c of very low sales.

Your experience with the Legacy selling for a good sum is like going the carnival and tossing a coin to win the fanciest of the glasswares. It can happen. This is both good and bad. Some people then feel good fortune is easily had and bet the farm. Hundreds in dollars in coins later, you realize the coin landing on the glass in the carnival was but a fluke.That said, yes I would say you buy what you like, and if it is discounted it is all the better. AND, I may add in some cases a car becomes just as good or better than the next due to hotter selling car if it has some function required. Cars like station wagons sell well later on, as they get the job done, even with dents and the most popular look is not so important in a car, when a family of four is the working poor. Trucks when new, could differer more due to some fad in style or advertising push, then later on equal out more in sales. And it is so true, you need not get as much as brand X, when you paid so much less for brand Y. As a side note, they have closed down the GM is on the offensive - will it work, forum.  Spin offs now include the GM is offensive forum........ :surprise: OK, just kidding.Loren "

I just received my October edition of Motor Trend, in which they compare the new Accord with the new Camry. In the side by side picture of the two cars, I think the Camry is much more attractive and aggresive looking. The writer suggests the new Accord reflects hints of a BMW 3 and 5 series......I disagree. I think the rear end is ugly (almost like a subaru legacy or a saturn) and the side view looked ugly too. I almost waited to purchase an 08 Accord based on the concept designs I saw, but am glad I purchased a Camry instead. I am a little disapppointed with the ""new"" look of the Accord. I think its ugly.....although some think the Camry is ugly. Just my two cents. "

Man, this brand bashing is getting boring. I don't think there is any vehicle in this discussion group that varies greatly from any other in reliability and by definition they are close to the same dimensions. So it comes down to price, safety, styling, ride, handling and features. Styling is pretty subjective unless something is just butt ugly(IMO doesn't apply to this group)and ride and handling is personal preference versus something good or bad. Safety is pretty close across the board except for Altima making ABS an option (rectified in '08 I hear). Features are quantifiable, but again are a personal preference but personally the more features for the money is something I appreciate. Price is a matter of negotiation and market conditions but there is generally two tiers in this class. The Honda, Camry and Subaru brands tend to be about 3-4000 more per comparatively equipped model than the other brands and they are worth about 2-3000 more a few years later so even price is somewhat of a wash. The main difference being the enjoyment more or less the owners experienced during that time.Bottom line: Most of the items that people are bashing each other about are really personal preferences so I like to view comments as if they ARE personal preferences rather than assume someone is trying to exert there wants/needs on all others.I personally would like to hear more about what the different brands offer and why you feel that way.

I agree that price and total cost is somewhat of a wash in the end. However, when posts refer to intellichoice, I point out the flaws because they claim the Accord is significantly cheaper to own than a Mazda6, for example. I don't think that claim should be left to stand, as if it were a fact. "

Well, first of all, Civics don't have too many options. Second, you didn't mention before that you were talking about the dealer's retail asking price, not trade-in value or (the number I was quoting) private party sale price. Sure, a Honda dealer will try to sell a 6-year-old Civic with 115k miles for over $9000. Will they get their asking price? Probably not. But maybe they will. Perhaps the guy who bought elroy5's Accord will need another car. One thing is for sure: you won't get that retail price if you try to trade in your Civic or sell it to a private party. So your depreciation needs to be calculated based on what you can get for the car, not what some dealer can try to get for it with their markup added. "

Why is it not a fact? Mazda6 resale values suddenly rise overnight? The asking price is way high, then they discount down to around the same price as a discounted Accord.

A Camry is not ugly, but does have the trendy too tall doors look, with flat sides. The rear Chris Bangle Modified X Toyota look is good, but the front nose is nothing short of odd. If you run down to Honda today, they have the '07's left. The New Malibu will be decent looking. And the Altima looks good, but alas some things I simply do not care for inside, and that CVT. If buying a stick, then it is a maybe. Hate foot emergency brakes, and the Altima is placed really in an odd position. New Mazda6 is on the way. The Aura XR is kinda cool, but look for discounts and watch out for trade-in values. Have not seen the 2008 Accord yet. I would imagine it to have the too tall doors. Note the 1"" tall and 3"" wider size, it is getting a bit large I think for an Accord. Sort of more the Avalon these days. L "

Why is it not a fact? Mazda6 resale values suddenly rise overnight? The asking price is way high, then they discount down to around the same price as a discounted Accord.Some have mentioned that a discounted v-6 accord could be had for around 23k. I wanted a manual tranny which is only available on the high end accord, so add 1-2 thousand to that price. I got a manual v-6 hatchback with a bose stereo and sunroof for 19.5k with $300 in accessories and 3 oil changes thrown in. So I don't know where you come to the conclusion that a Mazda6 sells for the same amount as an Accord... And when I looked on KBB a couple months ago, the retail value of my car was about the same as what I paid for the car 18 months prior and the private party value was less than 1500 less than what I paid. Not bad resale value for me... of course if you're basing your statement to msrp then you'd be right in saying that the 6 does not hold it's value well. But based on what many others have been able to buy their 6's for, it's been a good value. "

Hard to know what you were looking at on the Mazda lot or what version of Accord they are comparable to. Was the final price $26-27K or was it $5K below those figures?What I know is that I and many others have bought Mazda6 4 cyl, ATX, sport value sedan for about $16,000. This version is comparable to the Accord SE, which all indications are sells for thousands more.What I also know is that anyone with any sense at all will not be paying several hundred dollars above invoice, as intellichoice claims, for a Mazda6 after the rebates of about $2000. So this overstates the mazda6 depreciation by about $2000. Now if someone can show me a $2000 rebate on an Accord, I'll accept that there is an equivalent error in the intellichoice depreciation figure for that model. "

I had the chance to drive a new Camry SE for a week while my Tundra was getting a new auto tranny put in at 43,000. Yeah, even Toyotas break sometimes. Thank god it was under powertrrain warranty. I liked the SE but thought it handled a little rocky even with the SE suspension and thought some of the silver plastic inside looked a little cheap. Ran good, nice shift points as it took off well but settled down to around 2k rpms at 70mph which I was impressed with. My Mazda6 I4 runs at about 2500rpms at that speed. Anyway, the thing I really disliked about the car was the view (or lack thereof) out the rear window while backing up. I'm about 5'9"" and between the headrests and the height of the back shelf I felt like I was backing up my pick-up. I guess it's partly the BMW type rear end and the height of the beltline that bothers me as I noticed that my arm was kind of at an odd angle(up) when I drove with my arm out the window which I like to do. It wasn't real comfortable in that respect. I did like the lighting on the dash though I wonder if I would get tired of it long term. "

Camry has resale value on its side also. But I'm not taken with the Camry's styling. Almost like it's trying too hard to be ""hip.""

I noticed Honda is favoring the side view in its ads on this site. Good idea, because IMO the front is not at all attractive, looking like something Daewoo might cook up, and the rear looks... well, just odd--as others have noted, like an old Saturn (not a good thing).

The '07 is non-offensive but nothing to write home about. I disagree about the interior at this point though, as the dash on the '07 is about 3-4 different colors and is evident where each piece intersects. Its especially bad around the passenger air bag. I guess if you have that much dash space, its hard to get the color molding consistent. Its funny because the '93 dash, after baking in the sun for 15 years, is still black, all the same color, and not at all cracked. Both Accords do a great job holding an infant seat, and the '07 even allows seating on either side. "

I was looking at automatic with the V6 engine. And those Mazda6 are over priced. Once discounted by $5k they descended into a more realist price. Pity those paying closer to retail. Seems like a nice car. Like any other car, just shop the prices to see how it compares. Close-outs brought it closer to being a safe buy. Otherwise the total price in and out is a lot more than buying an Accord or Camry. That said, as always this it but one consideration. If you like the car, that is possibly above all consideration, unless you are a numbers man -- one that lives to save a penny. Intellichoice will not know about some dealer offering $5K off in your hometown. Things vary. Using an average to buy and the average when sold, Mazda6 will lose. Deep discount and it become more even, but you still may lose. It is not a good game for Mazda. The Miata after 18 years of ownership may still bring you $3,000 or more, but that is the exception. Mazda seems to have soul, which is precious rare these days. L "

Has anyone seen the Accord for 2008? From the photos, it looks pretty good to me. The front is more orderly to me than is the New Malibu which is split the three ways. New Malibu should be on par with the rest overall for looks. SEE LINK but I am not sure I like the looks of the pricing. Starts at $20K and the as shown is $27K ??? A Malibu @ $27,ooo? Isn't a base SAAB 9-3 something like that with a stick? And are they not deep discounted? It better look like solid gold in the showroom. Will stop in a Caddy dealership to see if the CTS is in the showroom yet. I hope it has not changed so much as to become a clone of a Fusion  with a let's show the world we are a Caddy front. CTS must remain edgy and its own DNA. (as always IMHO, and your smileage will vary )Hey, on the left here and ad shows the Hyundai Sonata, starting at $17,345. Wow, almost $3K under the New Malibu, before discounting. Folks, it is getting pretty ugly out there in the car wars. Good for shoppers though :shades: Loren "

Guess they use to sell cars by the pound, in ascending dollar value. Today I would say it is in descending order, as the lighter the car the more it cost to build, yet the performance increase can prove to be a positive. Cars handle better with less bulk weight and get more MPG. Heavy could be more steel in areas for safety, which is not a bad thing, but usually it means less engineering done to provide a light and safe car, and less use of lighter metals. If talking interior or overall size, I am thinking a used Crown Vic should do it - plenty large and should be safe. Then there is the Impala for a few more MPG and slightly smaller size.L "

Here in the Pacific NW, it's pretty common for mazda6's to be advertized for 6-7k off of msrp (including rebates), so it would seem the advantage over an Accord would be at least 3-4k from the start. The Mazda6 was reported to be one of the least expensive midsize cars to insure also. Both the Accord and the Mazda6 have scored well in crash tests where and when side airbags were used on these cars (I include European tests here since some US tests don't use the Mazda6 w/ airbags). The Mazda6 was tested to stop 10 feet shorter than an Accord in midsize comparo's by Edmunds and other car mags and the consensus of these articles have the handling of the 6 as the better of the two without giving up much in terms of comfort. Personally, I like the interior of the Accord because of styling but not because of better materials (the seat material on the 6 I think is better) or because it's bigger (most measurements of leg room and headroom are pretty much equal b/t the current Accord and Mazda6). From an external styling perspective, I much prefer the looks of the 6 and still get compliments from complete strangers pretty frequently. If a buyer of the 6 chooses a hatchback or wagon (which won't be available much longer), the Mazda6 will have the ability to haul much larger objects. Gas mileage on the Accord will likely be about 10% better, which would save the average driver about $500 a year based on 12k miles annual mileage. Jd Powers and Consumer Reports indicate that the difference in reliability is likely to equal less than one problem per car per 5 years (I think the Accord average was around 3 problems and the 6 was a fraction higher). Maybe I've been watching too much of the US Open lately, but it seems to me the Accord is like Sampras while the Mazda6 is like Agassi. Both are excellent, but their personalities are quiet different. I always had my favorite, but in the end it was very hard to root against any one of them. In the end, a solid case could be made for both and I wouldn't fault anyone for choosing one over the other. "

""Jd Powers and Consumer Reports indicate that the difference in reliability is likely to equal less than one problem per car per 5 years (I think the Accord average was around 3 problems and the 6 was a fraction higher).""The importance of that one extra problem (which may occur during the time you own the car over 4-7 years) depends, of course, on what that one extra problem ends up being, exactly. If the trademark power swinging vents stop swinging, well, no big deal (for me at least). However, if it ends up being much more serious (and thus expensive and/or unsafe), that is something to consider.Don't get me wrong, I think that JDP and CR data is good for comparison purposes. However, I wish somebody would take it further, maybe weight the results for the severity of typical problems and not just number of occurances. Plus, as I said before, I'd like to see breakdowns by model (e.g. not just overall Mazda6 reliability... but Mazda6 I4, V6, and turbo reliability).This would add real value to the results as we would have more accurate data. For instance, if examples of car A have a common failure in the radio, and some examples of car B occasionally have one vital component suddenly fail... even though they have the same number of problems per vehicle, the two cars will no longer be ranked as equal in terms of reliability.This brings up some interesting questions if you really think about it. Example, how much of BMW's reported reliability decline, shown as higher numbers of reported problems per car, might be related to owner complaints about iDrive ""not working"" (when they can't figure out how to operate it) or just simple gadget failures as opposed to real engine or transmission problems?

It's like comparing BMW and Mercedes: yes they are both in the same cost class, but they are intended for different customers.The Mazda6 probably tends to be bought by younger buyers (lower initial cost, sporty design and handling reputation) or buyers who are looking for something that, at least by reputation, is more sporty.The Accord tends to be bought by folks who want something that has an strong reputation for reliability and great resale.Before I get jumped on, that is not to suggest that either vehicle cannot score points in the other vehicle's strong suit (I have a 6-speed V6 Accord EX-L and would certainly describe it as sporting- just a little undercover...).But I will say I went for the Accord for reliability and resale, performance was a bonus.Again- different customers for each car.

It wasn't bad. I'm not a Indy driver but it wasn't as tight and hdid have quite a bit more lean in the corners than the 6.

I'm certainly not within the so called Mazda demographic, but I was looking for a third vehicle for my wife and I that was reasonably priced, less operatiing cost and a little more fun to drive than a SUV and PU which are our other two vehicles.

Too bad Mazda dropped it for 2009.The picture may not do the interior justice, but there's something about it that screams ""cheap hard plastics!"". Hopefully that's not the case. I am also noticing a certain sameness in mid-sized car interiors lately. Maybe that's because car makers get slammed for putting air vents anywhere but high-up, so that's where they go. Then there has to be room for the nav screen. And then it seems almost everyone is using the 3-dial approach for HVAC controls.

Well Mazda is simply asking too much for the car as suggested retail, if they have to discount it so much. Someone at Ford/Mazda needs to make some changes in the pricing.

Very nice. Current renditions, in more aerodynamic shapes are good too.As for comments on looks, I like 99.9% of the public have only photos to go by for the New Malibu and the New Accord, and commented that the looks are on par with the rest. Your response is: quote: not in my opinion and not in the opinion of many who have seen it in the flesh.  Well then OK, it is not then on par. So sorry to hear that.As for my comparing the Saab 9-3 to the cost of the Malibu LTZ, I do realize there is an engine difference. Of course if you can not drive fast with 210HP, 252HP won't do you any good. It is a drive, handling kinda thing. Seriously, they do have a different nature about them, but what I am saying is that image wise, as in what one perceives as a value of a brand, the SAAB is going to win every time against that of a Malibu. Now, it could be the new SAAB is nothing more than another Epsilon GM car, with a different motor, but I would hope for more. The better handling, more world class interior, and safety beyond the common car. Or is it just another mid-sized average car? If it truly is a SAAB and is priced at or below the New Malibu, when discounted, then I think the New Malibu is well overpriced. In total in and out cost of ownership, they have to come in under the competition, not with the price or over the price. If you can but the Aura XR for $24K with $1,500 or more discounts, how the heck do they justify $27K say for the New Malibu?

Gas mileage on the Accord will likely be about 10% better, which would save the average driver about $500 a year based on 12k miles annual mileage. You better check your math. If 10% saves $500, that means $5000 in annual gas cost. That'd be about 1600 gallons. which is enough to go about 40,000 miles. :surprise: 10% would be more like $150 per year...which is right about what fueleconomy.gov comes up as the difference, at least for the 4 cyl automatics.

The speculation though has been that the US will get the hatch and sedan but not the wagon. We'll find out for sure in a couple weeks. and to jeffyscott, I'd have to agree about the exterior; it doesn't seem to have as much flow to it. there are a couple elements I like, like the fogs and folding side mirrors, but no turn signals on the mirrors and no side markers? doesn't seem very safe, especially with a lot of bicyclists on my way to work. and it looks like the rear of the car is a bit higher which may make rearward visibility worse. The pronounced wheel arches still give it that ""mazda"" look, which is good. And the taillights look like what they have been playing around with on their concept cars.The interior shots I like a lot. The brushed aluminum trim is much better than the current chrome and I like what they have done with the seats (similar to what they have done with the cx7 & cx9). I also like that the interior isn't so monotone. But for mazda, the most important thing will be how it drives, so I'll wait for that info. Still exciting though! "

Very true, there are plenty of Model A on the road, and some Model T's. In Cuba most cars are what, say in the 1950's era? I see almost as many '65 and '66 Mustangs on the road as the New Stang..... OK a little exaggeration. If trying to save money, just get a used Impala, Crown Vic or something pretty basic and drive it 'till it drops. In most cases people want more than just the cheapest to own vehicle. For a commuter or work car, almost any used domestic, bought near half price in say three years time or so, should do. A salesman friend of my Dad said he use to buy a Civic with 100K on the odometer and drive it another 100K then start on over again, and said it worked for him back when he was a salesman. He liked the gas mileage and the cheap car to buy and still was able to sell it for something after 200K. One could argue that the Japan cars are best to take to 200K, just as well as there are valid arguments on the domestic car side of the issue, and those cars could be as cheap or cheaper to 200K. I would bet on the Japan make for in the i4 engines, and the domestics with the V6 & V8 may have the dollar edge over that period of time. Like I said, would bet on, and I doubt anyone has enough research to say one way or another, with any certainty. Would there not be two classes of long lived experiences, or is that three. The commuter may buy a Hyundai, or say the Civic and drive it until it dies, as would someone who sees a car as transportation. That be two classes, which are closely related. The third class is the collector, or one in love with the car. If I am gonna drive a car to 200K, I would really want something desirable to drive, a I am not the commuter to work class of driver. How much the car costs to own over the period is not as important as how good the ownership experience is. Just trying to imagine say 15 years of owning a Beretta, or Taurus or..... well let's say it would seem an eternity.L "

To sum up what I've heard about the '09:Initial rumors had both the 5-door and wagon dropped for NA in '09, but lately, there has been talk of the 5-door resurfacing here for the second-gen model. The 3.5L V6 from Ford will NOT be used (since Ford can't supply enough of them, supposedly), but the 3.7L V6 that's currently in the CX-9 will step in. I've heard that the 3.7L is slightly related to the 3.5L DT, but extensively reworked by Mazda, and I've also heard it's a Mazda-only design. Either way, it'll supposedly be built in Japan. Expect about 265-270 HP.The 6-speed manual and 6-speed auto is a certainty, and since it's based on the Mondeo platform, so will optional AWD. It may be a modified version of the Haldex with RWD-bias, similar to the SH-AWD that Honda has.It will be larger, but Mazda claims it'll be lighter than the current car, with better gas mileage.Of course, this is all speculation, and we'll find out more when press days start at the Frankfurt show on the 11th (hopefully).

I personally will probably never keep a car to 200k miles. I only put 8-10K miles a year on each of our cars, and the car will probably rust out from all the road salt long before it hits 200k miles.I do know that the one Honda I owned for longer than 3 years, a Civic that I owned for almost 8 years and 80k miles, required more in replacement parts than any other car I've owned, including vehicles from so-called unreliable brands such as Dodge and Hyundai. So statistics can deceive if people think that they guarantee a reliable car, short- or long-term, just because the average reliability of its brand is a tick higher percentage-wise than another brand.

So I wonder if Mazda would ever consider the ""active suspension"" that the Mondeo will be getting where the driver can change the suspension characterstics (like land rover)? But one thing I've really liked about the current 6's suspension is that it is both firm and compliant where there is not a lot of body roll but bumps rarely show up as being harsh and are absorbed and softened nicely. After seeing what Mazda has been releasing over the last 6 years, it's amazing how much they have changed and improved. From a stable of really forgetable cars except the rx-7 to where they are now, Mazda has become a company with soul and a focus to offer fun to drive cars that are stylish and affordable. "

When the new 6 arrives to the US, they won't be 2008MY, but rather, 2009MY.Both the Sport Wagon variant and MazdaSpeed6 are dropped for the 2008MY (US market).

I know Mazda originally planned to sell 140K of the 6 annually, well, they are well short of such goal (I think they are averaging about 70K, which is even less than the 626, IIRC).

He's changed the oil every 3-4K miles, annual air filter change and replaced the spark plugs twice and that's it.Absolutely no mechanical repairs in the 14 years he's owned it. His front windows stopped working earlier this summer however.

Well, legally - from a title and insurance point-of-view - I own a Galant, but it's really my son's car! It has been totally reliable, even though he's rather tough on it and quite negligent on routine maintenance. Currently, it has 165,000 miles on the clock, and it just keeps going (it's a 1996). The last maintenance was a timing belt, water pump, and P.S. pump a few months ago. It's been a good car for him, really bullet-proof. We bought it used in June 2001, and it's never let him down, nor been in the shop, except for preventive or proactive corrective maintenance. The 2.4L balance-shaft I4 doesn't burn any oil, but it leaks a bit from the distributor seal off of the cam cover. And, the 4-speed automatic still is original and shifts fine.Oh, and on the previous post, we see -20F occasionally here, but only 100F rarely, more like 95F.

I have read that in CA and some other states, the timing belt replacement interval is 105k miles, but in many other states (such as MN) it's 60k miles. Maybe in colder states, where the temperatures can get below zero (and also over 100, sometimes it seems in the same week :sick: ), the manufacturers adjust the maintenance schedules accordingly (Pat, that last was NOT a mention of the Accord).Actually, I don't have to change the timing belt on one of my vehicles at 60k because it has a timing chain, which many vehicles in this class have.

The current V6 Accord has a timing belt. I think it's because a chain would be too long and heavy. A belt is lighter, so it takes less hp to turn.

The fact that this car happens to have a name Honda Accord makes it a topic that's fair game. And why are you so sensitive to my talking about a car that you think should not be in this discussion yet cars like the civic and 20 year old cars are brought up without your saying a thing? Of all the things to become sensitive about you get upset about me talking about the Accord coupe's huge blind spot... "

I don't understand why everyone isn't using timing chains instead of belts. It's not like it's brand-new technology.A belt is lighter, so it takes less hp to turn. The benefits of the belt obviously outweigh the cost of changing the belt every 105k miles.Yeah, right.The ONLY advantage a belt has is initial cost. Yes, a chain may weigh a pound or two more, but if you compare two EXACT engines, one with a belt, one with a chain, the HP difference would be negligible at best. Plus, the chances that a chain will leave you stranded compared to a belt are slim to nil.A belt is just another way for automakers/part makers/mechanics to make $$$. "

I personally am all for timing chains; however the reason I believe that belts were predominant till recently was the smoothness imparted by a rubber belt compared to a metal chain (NVH). In cars from the 50s vintage, I believe all cars used to have chains, and later on these were replaced by rubber belts.Today, that is not the case, most of the disadvantages of chains are gone, so we see more and more engines with chains instead of belts.

Who here owns a Galant, Legacy, or Optima? When I bought the Contour, within 2 days I was totally sure I made the right choice. I loved that car. '96 SE V6 with a stick and loaded...man that car was so fun, and the seats were incredibly comfortable. Anyway, that car got replaced by a '05 Legacy wagon 2.5i stick for my family. Again, within a couple of days, I knew I had made the right choice. It does everything I could possibly ask of it, returns good fuel economy, and has been flawless since we got it. Mileage is strong (real world mileage has been comparable to its FWD counterparts), it has a wagon body style that has proven very useful, it tows a small trailer with no issues, visibility is very good and the seat height adjusts which is important because my wife is so short. I even like the headlamp cut off pattern.The only things I don't like are the way the infant seat fits in the middle spot and the lack of space left over for other booties in the back seat. I also wish I had gone up 1 model to the 2.5i Limited for the heated seats/mirrors and sunroof.** edit ** I forgot to mention, the car is fantastic in foul weather, even with the below par RE-92s "

Yes, I think one of the reasons belts dominated for awhile is that they are quieter. But lately it seems chains are dominating the new engine designs. For example, Hyundai/Kia is now using chains on both their new I4s and V6s, but still using belts on the older engines e.g. the Beta II. "

The Contour had a timing chain, the only time it required a hook was when the water-pump failed. The water-pump had failed under warranty and was replaced at that time as well, so timing chain and 3 water-pumps, one of the a catastrophic failure.The Accord has had 3 water-pumps, each replaced at the timing belt service.

During my lunch break, I decided to take it for a spin and was very impressed with it's handling. Much like my 1996 Legacy GT, the steering was very direct and positive while torque at lower rpms was decent making coming out of corners pretty fun. I'd imagine having a manual would be the better way to go though. Still, the car was quiet but not isolated; a great car with a lot in common to the sonata and accord. "

I like the way the Subie kicks a little when you turn it on, since the engine is longitudinally mounted, and the flat-4 growls a little more. Its definitely a more connected, tactile driving experience.The Accord, with the exception of wind and tire noise, is pretty darn quiet.

It's not a big deal, but how much would it cost to just have glass there? Or if you don't want the cost of the odd shaped glass, then don't design the c pillar like that.It's still not clear to me whether it's plastic or glass...if glass, it is kind of wierd to have two little pieces back there.

Thanks for the info. I bet something like 600 pixel width would fit nicely. Speaking of fitting nicely, is there such a thing as too big for smaller and mid-size classed cars. I am not sure if I am in the majority, or minority here, on the issue of size but it seems to me like a small car or a mid-size car blown up, as they are once again doing, is simply wrong. If I want to buy a tank or a land yacht I would do so. I happen to live in a city with narrow streets, so a car like the CTS fit pretty darn good. It is a mid-size car, or at least it was. An inch or two difference is not going to render the car impossible to navigate or park in those narrow space, but it means they are on the track for super-sizing. Seems like if the Civic grows any more, it will be a mid-sized car, and the Fit no doubt grows to replace it. How silly is that? Plans for the new Camaro and Challenger cars call for a monster width nearing 80"", which is pretty much truck width or some barge like a Town Car. What's up with that? I thought super-sized Pony car, as in too large Mustang killed sales back in the early 70's. They took a wonderful sporty size, then kept growing into something it was never meant to be.There is the value of the SUV and Minivan, as mass people movers, they fill the gap left from the largest of cars in width leaving the market.I personally, as in IMHO, see most cars, even the new Impala as better if they keep width and length under control, and leave the 5 to 7 passenger capacity to say the minivan. This is not to say a mid-sized or large car or today can not carry five, or possibly six people, but are they in great comfort, or feel more like a hostage? I have a mid-sized car, and it could carry five across town, but I would not want to go cross country. There is no way I am wanting this car though to be larger, and I here it grew an inch taller and three inches longer. To me that is alright, if you want a large car. It is no longer a mid-sized. Let the SUV/Minivan/Crossdresser vehicles carry the massive loads, IMHO.One more thing on size. Not sure the Epsilon GM cars need an extra inch in with as much as possibly narrowing that central area of the console so the knee doesn't hit there or rests easier there, when the foot is on gas. This could be a case where adding an inch is needed, unless it can be done on the inside only. Maybe both, an inch overall car width and eke out an extra inch inside in addition for add a couple. Just a thought. I find the Aura to be pretty comforatable, but a little change wouldn't hurt, especially in this super-sized world of cars and people. :shades:  "

If your mirrors are adjusted correctly you really shouldn't have a blind spot in any car. I was talking to a friend and they were talking about a blind spot. I told them to lean towards the center of the car and adjust the passenger side mirror so they could see the other lane. When they leaned back to driver postition they said they couldn't see the side of their car. I said why do you want to see the side of your car, the object is to see the other car, not yours. Same thing on the driver side. Lean over to where your head hits the window and adjust the mirror out so you see the lane next to you, not the side of your car. I find that when I adjust the mirrors like this I can drive looking pretty much straight ahead and if I'm in the middle of three lanes I can see the lane behind and both sides by glancing at the mirrors. I might lean a couple of inches but I certainly don't have any blind spots. I noticed this when I would drive the car after my wife drove it. The mirrors would be angled so far in towards the car I couldn't believe it. I find lots of people need to see the side of their car through the side mirrors and that just isn't the point. "

Yep, been doing the side mirrors sort of that way for years. But I think the way to do it is lean your head over and then adjust that mirror so you can just see the side of your car. Then when your head is back in the center you won't see the side of your car, but will have little or no blind spot (The front of a passing car will appear in your peripheral vision before the back of it leaves the side mirror).And if I do need to see the side of my car, such as backing around something I can do so by leaning my head over.Another advantage of this mirror setting is you don't get headlight glare, via the side mirror, from cars that are directly behind you.

Appreciate the link. I understand the arguments against the ""new way"". However, if you draw normal width traffic lanes around the vehicles you can see that the vehicle with mirrors adjusted traditionally would leave huge blind spots directly in the lanes to the right and left. I have used this new method for thirty years and I have never failed to keep track of a vehicle in my rear view mirror as it moves and is then picked up in the side mirror. Same as when the overtaking vehicle moves out of view in my side mirror it is then showing in my peripheal vision.In the illustration for vehicle one, it seems that the total of all mirrors views end up directly almost within the same lane directly behind the vehicle.This could be something that seems to work for me and maybe I've been lucky to avoid any accidents involving not seeing a vehicle when changing lanes or similar maneuvers.

As pat notes I recently commented on the 4 cylinder 2.4 liter engines used in both Kia Optima and Hyundai Sonata on another topic thread in this site. My original post/reply was directed at comments by a 2007 Sonata owner who felt his car didn't have enough power. He lives in western Pa which is mountainous and I noted we traveled to western Pa using rented Optima's and Sonata's at various times recently. Some here may remember that at the time I had sort of an informal comparison between the Optima and a Ford Fusion (both 4cyl. automatics) that I subsuquently rented after turning in the Optima.. Anyhow I commented that I felt the Optima/Sonata both felt sufficiently powerful even with 4 passengers and their luggage climbing the Allegheny mountains. Both felt, dare I say...snappy...from a dead stop. And despite all the talk about ""refinement"" when discussing engines and how Honda/Toyota have a ""lock"" on that particularly tenuous property the Hyundai 4 was just as smooth at idle (quiet too) as any Camcord I have seen. Quiet too when accelerating. The transmissions on both cars shifted smoothly and did what transmissions are designed to do..be in the right gear at the right time. I grew up during the great muscle car era and owned a few myself. I believed ""too much power is never enough"" and to this day prefer a V-6 when both a 4 along with a V-6 is offered on a particular car. Having said this some modern 4's are tempting me because they are more than adaquate. I wonder if Honda in offering a 200 HP 4 cylinder for the newest Accord will prompt a 4 cylinder horsepower race?? "

I agree, I think that link exaggerates any problems. I have also checked many times and, just as you indicate, the front of the car appears in the side mirror before the back leaves the rear view mirror. I don't see a problem with needing to move my head around in parking, much rather do it in that very slow speed situation than when driving 70 mph on the freeway.Motorcycles are always going to be harder to see, no matter what you do with your mirrors. As a former rider, I was always well aware of this and spent as little time as possible next to any vehicle in a spot where I could only be seen if the person were to turn his head or look in a mirror.I do still take a look before changing lanes, I just have more confidence that I know what is around me when I can see everything at all times, without the need to turn and look. So anyway, ""blind spots"" in midsize sedans are not an issue for me  . Now, the trend toward toward super-high (and super short) trunk lids...that is one I don't like. I don't want to have to slide things in the trunk horizontally and the visibility when backing up is better if the trunk lid is not so high. "

Yes, I agree my 1K estimate for ""virtually no repairs"" is high. I guess I was used to my domestic vehicle that always had 2 or 3 problems by the time I took the time to take it in for service repairs every 2 to 3 months. So a broken AC might be 750 dollars, but the timing belt the compressor just burnt needing replacement pushes that up to 1,000. Anyway, I guess we can compromise and say virtually no repairs is anything under $600, and furthermore does not occur with any regular frequency (less than biannually). "

I have my doubts about Mitsubishi being around the USA much longer. I live on the Central Coast of California, a virtual import car zone, and there is not a dealership within a 135 miles of where I live. This is wrong. The dealerships can not make a go of it here, I would say elsewhere USA is doomed. They have made some interesting looking cars over the past decades, but it may soon be over. I owned a Dodge Stealth, alias Mitsubishi 3000. Seemed to me that part prices were pretty high, but perhaps it was just that new model. The car was not the same reliability as other Japan makes, at least in my case. Yes, a small sample of one. Now the car was not too expensive, really cool looking and got the most positive comments and looks from people of any car I have ever owned. It seemed pretty sturdy over all, but just short of trouble free in its life with me. A Galant, IMHO, is an interesting looking car, as it has some extra style to it. But if sales are lacking, I fear for the dealerships in America, and thus I am out where it comes to any consideration of the products. They have brought some interesting products to America over the years -- hope they can survive as a provider of cars to North American Sales. L "

I don't have links, but i've seen stuff out there showing that nissan has less warranty claims for their CVT's than they had with autos. And a good deal of the ones that need fixed/replaced are because people put regualr dextron II in them. But, most of the time a CVT will be cheaper and easier to fix than a traditional auto. It just has less parts and simpler design. Thats the beuaty of them. take all those gears, gear clusters and other parts of a the auto and replace it with 2 pullies and a belt. "

Its a belt, but not a toothed rubber belt like a timing belt though. and going back to the whole belt/chain thing, even though it only cost me $400 to replace the belt on my honda, once again, its $400 I didn't have to spend on any of my nissans.  that puts the total money spent on the 5 year honda at $800, and a total cost of $0 for the 9yr old nissan.And there's no golf cart feel on the xtronic, at least on the altima.

Well I didn't care for the CVT tranny, and the emergency brake placement looked to me closer to where I would expect a clutch to be only higher up. Wonder if it comes in contact with the legs in an accident. Hate those foot brakes for the emergency brake. The push button starter was kinda a cute like thing. Overall, it did not feel as solid and quiet built to me as did the Accord and Aura when test driven. To each his own, I guess. The looks of the car is great. And the power is great for the i4 engine. I see you have a Nissan of nine years without any repairs needed. That is a record, and I bet you are happy indeed with that - I would be. My Dad had a '91 Camry that way. Never a day back at the dealership. Those are rare finds, even in the Japanese car lines. While $800 in five years is money spent, it pales in comparison to the days of domestics woes in the 70's, 80's and even the 90's where in three to five years some cars were ready to be retired. Trust me, been there, had it happen. And in nine years, I would be surprised to see them in any shape at all which I would feel comfortable driving one more than a across town.L "

I have to agree with you, the emergency brake is in about the worst place possible. I can't help but wonder what they were thinking with that.And yea, I know there is some luck involved with 9 years and no repairs. But I still think its a minimal amount of luck. I've always contributed the longevity of my vehicles more to the fact I take very good care of them than anything else. The honda has been just as good. Most of the 800 was for the timing belt, which is maintanence, not repair. So, Its more like $300 over 5 years. Thats why I always qualified my posts with winks, or intentional statements that the bill was small or expected. Just tounge in cheek humor. The timing belt is a great example. Even though it cost 400 or so to replace, i don't mind because it does have an advantage over the chain. If the chain in either of my nissans should go, and both being DOHC engines, I'd be lucky to get it fixed for less than 1500. looking at it that way, the 400 once, twice, maybe three times over the life of the car ain't so bad. :P "

If there are listings for San Luis Obispo, those date back over two years ago, as does any listing for Santa Maria, as in Ford and Mitsubishi. Let's see, it was Valley Mazda in SLO and they are gone completely -- Mitsubishi is gone due to no sales and later on the Mazda closed when the owner retired. Oxnard?

Depends on where you live I geuss... in my area, it's not uncommon for the Mazda6 to be advertised for 5 or 6k off of msrp after all rebates. I've actually seen them go as low as 7k off! If you can wait until fall (like near thanksgiving) when car sales typically fall off, you can probably get an even better deal. But regardless, with all the concern about the economy b/c of the mortgage issues, car sales have not been all that great which should be an advantage for you. Go to the library on a Sat or Sunday and check out all the newspapers within a 150 mile area, photocopy the best ones and take it to your dealership. Mazda also has a way to check inventory in your area, so send emails to their sales dept and see what kind of deals you can get that way. Regardless good luck and do not be intimidated!

I have owned 4 Nissans in the past 18 years with 3 of them using timing belts and never had any problems with the timing belts. Cost of replacement was not a problem since I did the replacement myself(More a pain of taking up time I could be doing something else).A couple months after I bought my 2002 Maxima a friend had the timing chain tensioner break on his 1998 Maxima leading to a costly repair. The car had a little over 60000 miles on it and was out of warranty. Neither system is foolproof but belts tend to be quieter and cheaper to build. All things considered I would rather have a chain simply since I usually keep my cars for a long time and it is 1 less maintainence item to deal with, although a chain can stretch and need replacement after many years of use.

That Contour reminds me of my first new car, an Opel Manta Rallye. Well, with a couple extra doors on it, I may add. As I recall the crash testing did not go well for that car. Then the car sales crashed. It just never flew. I wish they would make another car sort of like that Opel I had. Nice little coupe. Today one has a mostly choices of designs which look similar to each other, with too tall doors, and huge headlamps, which evidently is the replacement for chrome and other accents of the cars of yesteryears. I suspect within the decades time, new car door will no longer use windows, and you will peer through a submarine scope to see around. And those trunks will be up to roof top heights, so in a way the station wagon returns :P I ended up getting an Accord '07, which may be the last of the reasonable ( a little big ) sized Accords, with tall, but not as tall doors, with large 17"" wheels, but not wagon wheel sized, and a bit large eyes, yet not overtaking the entire front just yet, car! When I decide to change this car for something else some day, perhaps it will have to be used. I mean enough already with the little windows and big butts on cars. Those 17"" wheels cost enough to replace, I am not looking for a 20"" wheel car some day. As for maintenance, like radiator flush and such, I would take it to an independent which charges much less than the dealership or those specialty experts for Imports, which translates into, let's double the price. A neighbor took a rock in his Volvo headlamp. They replaced the whole thing at something like $450. Dang, that use to be an engine overhaul  And you can still get a GM 350 engine for what, say $1,750? This was just a crack on the headlamp, not a major incident. Wonder what Volvo charges for a $30 oil change -- $60 - $80 ??? Just nuts.L "

Buick couldnt sell enough of them and as Opel prices went up and up becuase of the mark to dollar exchange rate were forced then to source the car out of Japan (Isuzu?) by the mid 70s - which were even worse POSs than even the Toyotas and Datsuns (Nissans) of he mid and late 60s.Opel is still a respected brand in Europe, and has the best selling car over there, the upcoming replacement for the Saturn Ion is that car - unfortunately saddled with the Ecotec 4). We also owe the Aura and the CTS to some of that German engineering. Headlights- here's one for you - own a HID equipped Avalon, got into a really minor fender bender, headlight lense had a scratch in it - headlight only available as an 'assembly' - cost to replace $1100.00 plus labor!

My original post/reply was directed at comments by a 2007 Sonata owner who felt his car didn't have enough power. He lives in western Pa which is mountainous and I noted we traveled to western Pa using rented Optima's and Sonata's at various times recently. Some here may remember that at the time I had sort of an informal comparison between the Optima and a Ford Fusion (both 4cyl. automatics) that I subsuquently rented after turning in the Optima.. Anyhow I commented that I felt the Optima/Sonata both felt sufficiently powerful even with 4 passengers and their luggage climbing the Allegheny mountains. Both felt, dare I say...snappy...from a dead stop. I too live in Western PA and agree that it probably felt snappy on the highways as pretty much anything built after MY2000 will. However, I would argue that it felt snappy if you tried starting off on one of our many very steep hills that have either stop signs or stop lights in the middle of them. Chevrolet is the #1 selling brand in the Pittsburgh area mostly, and this is IMO, due to the availability of a V6 in almost everything they sell. Lots of Impalas and Montes around here. I myself always opt for at least a V6 anymore after thoroughly struggling with a Civic and ZX2 on the hills for a few years. Not much choice in that class though. I just got back from the OBX today and did notice an Optima or two (may have been the same one, both I4s) flying by on the PA turnpike. They looked perfectly at home at a high speed and I have no doubt they are perfectly adequate for most people. I am not one of them due to the area in which I live however. "

Have an 07 Optima and an 05 Maxx. The Optima kicks from fifth all the way down to third on lots of grades. The Maxx gets slightly better mileage even with the four speed and 3.5 V-6. The Optima is considerably smoother, however. Hyunkia engines are notoriously tight and my suspicion is things will get better than 30 on the highway once things loosen up--5000 on my wife's car right now.If you can stand the high rpm's on grades the Optima does have adequate power. If I use the manual shift, it doesn't kick down and still seems to make grades-- the Ozarks aren't the Allegheny's however. "

The 90K check was invoiced at 5 labor hours, cost ~$500, and the list of what they actually did isn't that long...lots of ""inspect this, check that."" Plus, it was out in less than 3 hours...did they really have multiple people working on it?

$1,100 + labor for a headlamp? Around '70 or maybe it was '71, I bought a used Mustang 289 for that -- yeap, it was $1,100.

And a warranty in those days was 12 months, i think. Always thought the Datsun 510's to be a bargain. Owned a used one back in say '82-'83-maybe into '84 which was perhaps a couple years old car when purchased, and traded it in for a loss of $800 in two or was it two and a half years. Of course the Mustang I bought new ended up in the repair shop, at which point I kicked myself for turning in the trouble free car. But alas, those 510's had such thin steel, they did not seem too safe, and they made the seats flat, so the buns went numb on longer trips. I have seen the new baby Volvo, which is very nice little thing. This one happens to be something like $27K, which is so over the top price wise. Isn't the new Astra something like $16K?

All this fancy technology permeating all new cars means one thing when replacement is necessary: big time money.

There are plenty of Civics, Corollas, and Mazda 3's here. I suspect the Pittsburgh story is more that it's in the traditional midwest rust belt and people just buy more American Cars. (Not slamming Pittsburgh, I've been there many times and it is a beautiful city in its hill and river setting.) There are a lot of small cars here too because those hills make the gas disappear faster as you well know. I think the tendency towards the larger Chevys though is, like I said, the readily available V6, and the weight. The heavier cars tend to do better in the snow (maybe not for stopping though :surprise: ) plus you need something big to take tailgaiting when the Steelers are in town.  "

LED are bright, illuminate faster, and should last ten years,or more. Looks OK to me. Yeah, lots of things in my new car look like expensive repairs some day. If I keep it longer than power-train period, say as a 7 to 10 yr car, perhaps it may be the first time I ever buy a warranty. Still thinking of buying a bit more simple car next time - something of a modern day classic perhaps, just pre-highest tech period. Just thinking about that. Right not, as in the next car purchase may be the sports car.At one time I was considering a larger car than my Accord for the everyday car. I am now of the belief this '07 is large, as in large enough, and the next full time car will be no larger or smaller. Small is just so user friendly in all so many ways. As for high tech items which are a bit of a thorn with me, right now I am thinking those thick A pillars for the air bags. So far, anti-lock brakes, stability control, and the rest seem like a good thing, though replacing / repairing is not gonna be all that cheap no doubt. I still kinda miss seeing a hood out front. Today's cars seem to have little to no visible hood out there. This is one thing I would look for in finding a modern day classic. Oh yeah, another thing is a good old fashion key instead of those $200 + keys.All in all though, the modern day car has safety, speed, gas mileage, ride, cornering, comfort and the like, which exceeds just about anything made before it. Not to say I don't appreciate the simple life. My Corolla and Miata had roll up windows, and manual door locks, so how simple is that. A key for those two, cost under a $1. each.You pay to play, as the gals in Vegas say. :shades: And modern has its play for more pay benefits.L "

If you can stand the high rpm's on grades the Optima does have adequate power.That's the part I hate. The Civic we had needed wound so high on the hills that I got dirty looks because it sounded like I was going too fast. I haven't driven a Honda lately but I understand they've alleviated some of that need for high RPM to produce the modest amount of power it takes to get you up hills and grades. It sounds like you are telling me Hyunkia hasn't come that far yet? "

It doesn't really matter if you call it maintenance or a repair... No, it really doesn't...except for ""talk"" here and it also might matter on things like CR surveys.But if Ford does not have a set time to change the timing belt, is it supposed to last the life of the engine? Yes, ""life of the engine"" is what they said when I asked. I believe typically they would last over 100,000 miles. It was not an interference engine, so you could choose to leave it until it breaks or treat it as a maintenance item and replace it proactively. "

Ah, the sweet sounds of a smooth running, high revving engine = no problem. Some old thrashing i4, or V6 engine, is pretty bad.

Our Explorer sounds awful when revved high but I think I've had to do that maybe twice in the year and a half we've owned it. All the power is down low and you move without drama.The Mazda6 S I had did need some fairly high revs to get going at a reasonable pace but it was much better than the I4 version of anything I can think of IMO.

I think you were trying to reply to me and not yourself? Anyway, my post was not talking about destination charges at all but was more about what the OP should be looking to pay for a Mazda6 based on what discounts I'm seeing in my area.I suppose all costs that a dealership puts on a car are negotiable, but how much wiggle room there is in destination charges is a complete mystery to me. Sounds like the car companies would prefer it that way too. Personally, my negotiations circled around the discount off of MSRP and not about dealer documentation fees or destination charges.

You seem to move well enough until up in the high speeds, when asked to pass. It is then where the SOHC or DOHC seem to shine. That said, they both have their good side to them. Not everyone will enjoy hearing a higher revved up engine. And there is limits to everything no doubt. You would not want to have to max the engine every time just to move across town. It had been some time, say around a decade of i4 engines for me, but I am back to a V6 again. Really do enjoy the extra power, and it comes in for safety in some cases when entering freeways, which seem more and more crowded these days here in California. There is just something smooth too about the not having to really work to get things going. I tell ya, the PT Cruiser it is really revving up the i4 and rowing the gears just at the right time, if you want to get anywhere in less than a snails pace. This is not to say I am not going to consider another i4 with a stick, and be doing the clutch and stick routine again, as another sports car is a possible in the near future. As for another sedan, one fine day, I guess it depends on how the cost of gasoline goes. They keep upping the HP for the i4 engines, so they are closing in on the at least the older V6 engines. Believe it or not, my current 244HP V6 is the most HP I have ever had, including the early 70's with my Mustang 289 at what, say 200HP? So this time I just thought I would go for the power. It's all good though, be it 100HP little i4 or having a 430HP Corvette, as it is the car in total which makes the difference. Those, less than powerful little Miatas can be a kick to drive. It's all good - just enjoy the drive! L "

I have never driven the AWD cars. Seems like they all would be good for snow conditions. But then again, I rarely am faced with snow, other than a once in a blue moon during a vacation or two. Got caught in snow coming back to CA from Las Vegas. I had a FWD Achieva, with new tires, and it did well indeed. There was enough snow, they closed the freeway at Baker that day, minutes after I reached the town. So I guess the FWD was a good thing. Nowadays, the computers can help sort things out though to keep you moving and upright, so I guess it is slightly less an issue. And wouldn't the 50/50 weight distribution be better in some cases, even in snow travel ? I can see most premium cars moving to RWD / AWD. I take most AWD cars like the Subarus are mostly FWD driving the wheels, with the occasional kicking in of power to the rear, or what 15% ? Never really researched the AWD cars based on FWD, as it doesn't seem an issue on the left coast USA. I do know that many Subaru owners seem to be fans of the cars, somewhat like those SAAB owners. Is this a cult car? Loren "

I have never driven the AWD cars.Me neither, except for a test drive of a legacy. The salesperson wanted to show off the AWD, had me accelerate with two wheels on snow/ice and two on pavement. It did fine, but then I later tried the same thing with my wife's jetta that has ESC and it did just fine too. I think subaru is full-time AWD and it's the Volvo system (also used by Ford) that just occassionally sends power to rear. I also have not driven a RWD car at all since about 1985 and that was a 1977 model. I suppose things may have changed a bit in 30 years  . I had a Ford salesman one time telling me the mustang would be fine in winter as long as you get traction control, never tested that claim though as I decided it was too impractical anyway. I guess if you got ESC in a RWD, that'd probably do just fine in winter. Also I'm sure real snow tires can help a lot, but I would not want the bother of tire switching twice a year. Since things get plowed and salted quickly all season tires and FWD work good enough to suit me 99% of the time. "

Can you edify me about how much of a reduced current load occurs from a fully-populated LED array of taillights, ala DTS/STS vs a 1056 tungsten bulb (whatever the right number :blush: )? The brake lights work only a tiny fraction of the time the lights are on. The running taillights are only on at dusk to dawn; that's a tiny percentage for most drivers out of the total time driven. I have trouble believing it's a meaningful reduction in load for the battery. Now if all bulbs on the car became LEDS including headlights I could believe there's a meaningful/measurable reduction. "

As you can see, over 2 amps is pulled by the regular bulbs. Less than 1/8 of that power draw is pulled by the LED&#146;s. Even more shocking is the actual brake circuit of the 1157 bulbs (not listed in the table). Each bulb pulls 2.08A when braking, while the LED&#146;s pull 0.12A. In this case, the regular bulb pulls 17 times as much current as the LED. Regular to LED Power SavingsSome caveats - the tests were done a vehicle not designed for LED lighting, he talks only about steady-state measurements, and he doesn't list the specification of the LEDs he is using. He also says something about the brightness, which is odd since there is a FMVSS standard for the output. I know the housings for LED lamps are different than those for incandescent, and since he was retro-fitting perhaps that was his issue. I find the brakelights on the Caddy and the G35 to be brighter than those on their non-LED counterparts.As far as replacing all vehicle lighting with LEDs, its on its way. Trailer lights have gone to LED to reduce the load on the towing vehicle's electrical system, etc. "

Well my '76 Starfire was no great work of automotive engineering. :P But I had fun with it, drove it I guess it was maybe six to seven years, then sold it as junk for $299 wholesaler. No one wanted to buy it. Wasn't high mileage or anything, just unwanted and it looked a bit tired. Bought a used Datusn 510 which ran great and looked A-OK, without parts falling off. Replaces a headlamp $17 and a hood prop clip for something like 50 cents a pair, and an inline fuse $1, but it took an hours labor to find the problem, as I had made the mistake of not going to a dealer and went to a service station for the repair. Anyway, not bad for a used car over a 2 1/2 years of service. Only lost $800 when I traded the car in. Dad then bought the next Olds, a station wagon, V8 with all of 140HP, I think it was for 1984. Not a great car, but it ran. His next car was a Camry, which he really liked. This car was impressive with zero defects in 9 years of service.Fast forward to today, GM has some better stuff to sell no doubt, but I am wondering how they are going to sell cars like the Epsilon series as being somehow all that better than buying a brand X. What is to set them apart from the rest. Way back when, one could argue that gee that new Datsun 510 say in 1968 sure has some features and gas mileage, but look we have this better styled car, with more steel and wouldn't it be more comfortable and safer than your 510. Or you could say, we have nicer seating, or more dealerships, and well you get the point. What now is the main selling point for GM, and Ford if the car is a much the same as car? How would you market the car. I see GM likes the All American Theme. But the old cars looked so much different than did the competition. You had a VW bug, a Subaru lighter steel little egg thing, a Honda with paper thin doors, and well some really lightweight contenders. I think back then, I would be more stylin' in a Chevy Nova II or a Falcon, or Fairlane 500. Will there be any attempts at style for cars in the mid-size or smaller? L "

The tires are over inflated slightly, 35 psi, and we are both conservative drivers.Over the same route of travel, our 1997 3.8-liter V6 Thunderbird with four-speed automatic transmission -- a larger, heavier car -- gets 13-15 mpg while our compact 2000 2.0-liter I4 Ford Focus station wagon gets 17-20 mpg.Given that this is 2007, I would expect the mid-size Fusion to be closer to the revised EPA estimate of 17 mpg for this power train and I'm very disappointed that, after nine months and 4,600 miles, it doesn't.I suspect the all-wheel drive is the mileage culprit. It's not something I would have specifically ordered, it's just how the car was equipped on the lot.Styling, handling and a good previous experience with the dealer weighed heavily in our decision to go with the Fusion, which is only available in three models: the S, SE and top of the line SEL.In retrospect, we should have shopped around more, taken more time. I was also under the impression that a four-cylinder mil would not be adequate but I now believe that is not the case.We still believe the Fusion is by far the best-looking mid-size in the marketplace and its features are top-notch, too. The fit and finish on our Fusion is perfect.Still, I have this nagging feeling that a four-cylinder Fusion, or even a four-cylinder Accord, would have made me happier nine months after the fact.At least the leather interior still smells good after nine months.

That was a bad memory. The Focus is fine, however.Today, a four-banger is probably adequate for 90 percent of the population, including me.Did I just read somewhere that Honda's new four is up to 200 horsepower?

That is still pretty bad that you don't get atleast 17mpg around town even with the AWD. The AWD in the Fusion is reactive, rather then pro-active. My brother has a 2006 Mazdaspeed6, same AWD system, heavily modded running around 300hp, and he gets 21-22 mpg's around town and 25 highway, when hes not punching it. "

agree with you on the 'looking bad' contention. It would seem therefore that the new Accord will be the 08 COY as this award is largely based on significance. What is more significant in this or any other segment than a vehicle that will likely be sold 400,000 times or so. It may poach enough Camry sales to become #1 again. The TL-S is that 'harder' Accord you are talking about, but I persnally feel that it falls well short of being a real sports sedan along the lines of the 335 and IS350 - limitations of high HP in FWD (or even FWD biased AWD sedans) "

Was that $23,800 sticker for the '06 EX with or w/o destination charge? With destination, the 2008 Accord EX sedan is $24,495. For someone who wants a really nice I4 mid-sized sedan, that is pretty good. However... it's only $250 less than a fully-loaded 2008 Sonata Limited V6 (after rebates available to all buyers). The Accord EX-L V6 is nearly $4000 more than the loaded Sonata Limited V6 (although the Accord V6 has the power advantage and a nicer interior). So the Accord is still relatively pricey, I'd say. The V6 model has moved into the next class up based on price, i.e. competing more with the likes of the Avalon, Lucerne, and Azera than the Camry and Sonata. "

I don't think the Azera can compete favorably with the 08 Accord. The new Accord is in a different league than the Sonata, IMO. Sure, the Sonata may come close, as far as features, but not in Class, Style, and Refinement. The advantage is more than just ""power"". "

The Azera is very close to the Accord in power. It is roomier than the Accord (and interior room is something Honda touts for the new Accord). And it's thousands less than the Accord, in real-world pricing. Class? The Azera is just as ""classy"" in my eyes as the Accord, with much more attractive styling. Style? That too is in the eye of the beholder. Refinement? Depends on how you define it. The Accord will out-handle the Azera. But the Azera is likely the superior highway cruiser, with a very smooth, comfortable ride and hushed environment.It comes down to what someone is looking for in a car. In moving the Accord up-class in room and price for 2008, Honda is for better or worse bumping up against another crop of competitors. If someone is looking for a roomy, luxurious, powerful sedan, there are several other good options out there besides the Accord, for the same or less money. I mentioned but three of them earlier: Avalon, Azera, and Lucerne. Even the CTS is in the same dollar ballpark as the Accord now. "

I am noticing a bit of tire squeal with my Michelin's on the Accord SE V6. When it comes to time to replace the tires, I may opt for less mileage and more grip, say something like a Yokohama or Kumho tire. Seems to me they are really favorably rated at the TireRack, yet low priced. Can not recall the rating professionals tests and consumer surveys on my standard tires, but I think they did OK. In interesting how you can get all season brand X tires which seem to do better than the expensive brands. That said, that too can be hype. One of those things you just have to test yourself. The Michi's should get me plenty of miles, and I would say seem to stick pretty good, though recently after 7K miles, they sure seem to squeal with more ease. Come rain season should be a good test. These tests done on new cars with stability control surely put the limits on those lateral g tests, don't they? And the slalom testing? I still call the Accord a sports sedan like ride, though I realize it can be taken wrong. Of course it is not a Bimmer, but compared to the slow, boat like handling, some of us old timer lived with, this nice cornering, with some good feedback to steering, without that one finger lightness, is so welcomed, I call it sports sedan like. And I am sure an Accord can be pushed through the corners, FWD - heavy nose and all, much quicker than most of the sports cars and muscle cars of days gone bye. I would not push my old pony, the 289 Mustang around a turn as fast as an Accord, or Camry, for that matter. And today's CTS vs, some old Caddy, is like night and day. Of course, there is more to life where it comes to cars, and we must honor the greatness of the old cruisers, or is that luxo liners, the wonderful ships they were.L "

Had a chance to drive a RX-8 and a Porsche Boxter this weekend (my uncle is looking for a fun to drive car to go with his lexus 430... don't we all feel bad for him :P ), and if you want to hear some sweet sounds from an engine, these two had it in spades though they sounded completely different. The rotary engine spins up soooo quickly but even at 8k, it does not sound stressed at all. And Mazda is really good at tuning the sounds in the cabin to make their cars sound pretty muscular, so the RX-8 sounded faster than it was. But as I drove it, I'm getting more and more impressed with how mazda tunes their suspensions and chassis. Although the ride is lively, it still dampens bumps really well. My 6 is very similar... though not as low as the RX-8, the suspension is a great balance of road feel and comfort that leaves you feeling engaged but not beat up. The Porsche was the same as far as suspension goes, but it's engine had a lot more testosterone to it... louder, rougher, deeper, but man, was it sweet! Definitely not as smooth sounding as the RX-8, but it's more raw sound was just as appealing. In some ways, the difference between these two cars is how I'd compare the sound of the Accord v-6 I test drove vs the Mazda6's Duratec. The Accord does sound really smooth and doesn't growl as much whereas the Mazda6 sounds more meaty, especially in the 3-5k rpm range. There is a rawness to the sound of this engine at 6k when the vvt is in full roar that still gets the hairs on my neck to stand up and all my senses are focused on the road ahead and the balance of the car... wonderful stuff!

 Well, is he going to try all the others, like the Corvette, BMW Z3, S2000 Honda, and such? Looking for new cars? Ya know, if my butt was more narrow so I fit in the MX-5, I would consider one. I personally only fit in the last generations of Miatas. For fun, as in playing in the country, there is nothing better. Now for comfort, I do fit in the RX-8 better. They burn oil as they run, and use a tad more gas, but handle like on rails, for what I have heard. Not sure how many mechanics are trained to fix those engines, but then again, low fail rate, I would think. That Porsche Boxster has to be one of the more expensive cars for an oil change, though I am sure others can even top it. I sure like the looks of the Porsche. And love the looks of the Cayman. That said, the old BMW Z3 was one sexy looking car, and had some great inline six engines in it. Of course on the track, people still favor the Miata, or those S2000 Hondas.

A Corvette is next on the list and that ought to be a blast too. We talked about the S2000, but for whatever reason, he's not too enamored by it. I get the feeling he doesn't really like cars that require high revving to get something out of it. Too bad, cuz that drops the lotus off the list  Really, I was very surprised that he wanted to try the rx-8, but car and driver had a really good write up about it recently so we gave it a shot. Although he liked the great handling and of course the value of it (some new ones can be had for around 22k), it felt a little too tight inside and low end torque was non existant. He is considering a 330, but given it's weight is a bit higher up, it's not too likely. The g37 got dropped because he thinks the suspension isn't quite as well sorted as the others mentioned, but he loves the drivetrain. The hardtop mx5 would be nice but they are selling very well and are a bit hard to find unless he gets an 08 which would be available in around a month. But more than likely, he'll get a two year old model f/ an auction and go from there. Regardless, some very fun choices available... "

When it comes to time to replace the tires, I may opt for less mileage and more grip, say something like a Yokohama or Kumho tire. Seems to me they are really favorably rated at the TireRack, yet low priced.Tires are the single biggest component on the vehicle that affects handling. Replacing bread-and-butter highway tires with a performance tire (something those of us with 4-cyl Accords can't do) will yield substancial increase in handling performance. Also, for your central coast climate, there is no earthly reason you need all season tires. A good summer tire is designed to handle wet and dry roads, and handle the down-poors the rest of the country sees in summer. You might look at the BFG Comp T/A KDW. Those were pretty phenomenal on the Contour, second to the Comp T/A R1s, which were soft compound dedicated racing tires with a treadwear rating of zero. I have also had good luck with the Kumho Ecsta ASX (their psuedo-all season) but would probably recommend one of their ""summer"" oriented tires for your needs.There is a whole Accord Tires/Wheels form discussion that might also be of interest to you.

Go rent an Accord for a week. Record your mileage under your actual driving conditions. Then see you will have a basis for comparison.That would be a fairly expensive proposition and I'm not so sure what it would prove. If the Accord got the same mileage, 14.8, I guess I would feel better. But if it got say 17-20 mpg in city driving I would be depressed. Besides, Accords are not available with AWD, not even the 2008s. In order to do a fair comparison the cars would need to have very similar drive trains.Also, while the fuel economy is poor, given the number of miles traveled, it sounds like the financial impact is negligible.Yup, we put very few miles on the car, 4,600 in nine months, so the pain is somewhat subdued, thankfully. To be honest I thought the car would deliver its EPA estimate. The original one was 19 mpg city/26 highway. The revised one is 17 mpg city/24 highway.On the only trip we have taken with it, a 360-mile jaunt, the Fusion did deliver 26 mpg going and 24 mpg returning with speeds of 60-70 mph.People on the four forums I visit report generally good mileage for the 3.0-liter V6 but very few report good mileage with the AWD option.As I've said repeatedly, our Fusion is a really nice car except for the gasoline mileage dealio. I would recommend one, without the AWD, to anyone and everyone.It's a personal preference thing, but I think the Fusion is the hands-down style winner in the mid-size segment but not everyone agrees, of course.

""It would if you are trying to gain share as opposed to just tread water. Remember, total sales of one brand is one thing, but overall segment sales are another. Chevy sells more midsize cars than Honda (if we count impala) and GM sells more midsize cars than Toyota (including all brands for both). If Gm consolidated all its brands and named all midsize non luxury sedans ""malibu"" it would outsell camry. The sales race for a particular brand is really about bragging rights and little else. F150 is best selling pickup and I'm not sure what that proves other than Ford has huge capacity to build them and they are willing to offer huge rebates to move them. "

Accord right now has a strong reputation going for it so Honda doesn't need to lower price in order to gain share. What they are doing is building a class benchmark with competitive pricing among the leaders (Altima and Camry) to win over potential buyers.Undercut in price what a new comer will do in order to gain share in a quick way. The best examples are Sonata and Fusion. Toyota is also doing the same thing for its new Tundra. "

The bottom line is Toyota (moreso than Honda) is bringing the transaction price of the camry down closer to the ""inferior"" competition to keep sales high.I hope the quote marks around ""inferior"" was meant as sarcasm because I don't consider the other mid-sizers to be inferior to a Camry.This is one reason why the Camry will remain the #1 car in American indefinitely.Unless there is another engine sludge episode.

All manufactures charge more for a V6. And this has been since the start of time; well automotive sales time that is. Hell, doesn't GM charge if you want real tires on your car? You can end up with Hankook or some other cheapo's on there. OK, maybe Hankook is a good tire - don't know, but it is a Korean tire. I thought GM was the all American brand? Looks to me like a 3.6V6 in the Aura XR has a premium price placed on it. No - Honda charging for a V6 is not out of the ordinary. Just get the SE to get the reasonable package associated with the V6 buy. Or pay more get all the other stuff, many seem to enjoy. Life has options. L "

Point is the fact that the camry needs $4k in discounts to sell ANY time is a testament to the fact that the car is priced too high. Its amazing how everyone is forgetting that Toyota (unlike its american counterparts) is supposed to be a master of supply and demand and not need to rely on sales to move products.

You are missing my point here, Honda is charging $2200 for the engine ONLY. Compare XR and XE and you will see they are separeted by more than a motor. You didnt mention that 6 speed auto, 18"" wheels, stability, auto climate control, 8 way seat, 6 CD changer, premium sound system and auto dimming mirror are included in the $3500 premium you pay for the XR. Not quite the same as what Honda is doing with the Accord. On the Fusion I think a V6 is worth about $1000-$1500 at the most. Most base models in the midsize segment come with ""cheap"" tires, Aura is no exception. Just because they are Hankook doesnt mean they are any cheaper than lower end continentals or goodyears. "

I think you can safely call the 2nd best selling family car in the country a 'benchmark'. The 2003-2006 model was a benchmark for the category. It would be surprising if the 2008 model is not also. That the 2008 has added features that it 'should've had a while ago' seems like an odd statement. They added features because it is a new model. They did not add them a 'while ago' because they haven't brought out an all-new Accord since 2003. "

That article is a little misleading. Remember, Honda has now dropped the DX/VP trim levels, making the LX the entry level sedan for 2008. The quote should be that a base model 2008 Accord (an LX) will cost $1,775 more than the outgoing 2007 base model (a VP). It should also mention that compared to a 2007 VP, the 2008 LX has much more standard features. IMO it is well worth the $1,775.MSRP for my '07 LX manual was over $20k, so the difference between the '07 LX and the '08 is not so much. The LX and EX were by far the volume sellers anyway, it is very rare to see a DX or VP.The only way that dropping the DX/VP may hurt Honda is in ""bait and switch"" style comparisons, where a competitor is able to advertise a midsize sedan for much less than $20k. Of course, their ad car would be stripped out, and to compare it to a base Accord wouldn't be apples-to-apples, but that is wait the bait and switch is all about, right? "

I bet ya there are owners of the Ford Fusion which would pay $2,200 for a Honda engine instead of a four banger, or for that matter the Ford V6. And when you get the SE V6 Accord you get a lot of stuff, including the alloy wheels with Michelin tires (17"" cost enough, thank you, I see no need for the cost of 18"" wheels, nor the extra unsprung weight) and it has stability control, and windows which can be lowered with the electronic key. An SE has a 5 sp transmission, which seems to work just fine. And no it doesn't had auto climate control, but then again, I can move the little dial for cooler or warmer, without it taxing my mind. Dimming mirror sounds a bit interesting, though I prefer, unless too painful, to have the better view behind me, and only adjust for those SUV and trucks with the taller light positions, which should be illegal. As for seats, it doesn't have lumbar support, and that is something which was an oversight on Honda's part -- should have been standard. The car is identical priced to the Aura XR. Well, at the time of purchase. In five years, we can pretty well do an educated guess as to which has the greater value. Aura XR is a pretty neat little ride -- pretty quick, with a sharp enough handling to satisfy most people. As for XE and XR pricing difference being more than a motor, the same holds for Accord SE i4 and V6. The i4 doesn't have stability control, for example. Not sure about the 2008 models. As for tires, I don't think Honda is going to use any cheap tire, but I could be wrong. Will have to look around next visit. Hyundai seems to use all Michelin's. I set a personal record for wear with a GM car in '86, as it had Goodyear Customs, which wore down in 8,000 miles. Never topped that one :sick: Loren "

What is more significant in this or any other segment than a vehicle that will likely be sold 400,000 times or soI read the article wehre the guy in charge of honda NA made that prediction. I'm skeptical, and guess that to be more wishfull thinking than anything else. Not that the car itself will be the reason, but sales of midsize cars have been dropping for a decade now, and is still falling. People want smaller and more fuel efficent. about the only way any manufacture can incrase their sales units in the midsize section is by taking from the other guy. considering the domestics +hyundai/kia and the rest have probably been beat down now about as much as they can be, you only have the altima and camry to take away from. and thats a pretty tall order even for honda. Add to the mix the current econmic climate, the high probability that the economy will continue to slow if not slip into recession and that 400k copies seems even less likely. I don't think the next couple of years is going to be very bright for any of the automakers. going to be real tough to start posting record sales with a vehicle that likely wont be discounted at all.

My 2003 had the 205/60-16 tires and I was able to replace them with a set of 2007 Accord rims and tires that I bought off of ebay for the price of new tires. The tires had little if any wear and the rims were spotless. The speedometer difference is only 0.9% difference which works out to about 1/2 mph at 60.

Drive the Sonata, and Accord V6 the same day. Test used ones, so you can punch the gas, take a few corners in each, seek out some bumps along the way, then get back to us with your conclusion.

Just taken through the paces of stop - go, turn, for the road test, then a good look around of interiors, and my bet is that the winner is not Sonata. The Aura XR comes closer for performance, though is a tad smaller inside than the Accord, and of course smaller than the Sonata. Sonata does have room inside. All three have some good points to them. My Accord has ESC, but the i4 engine Accords do not. Actually, this is or was the Sonata selling point, from warranty to most features per dollar, we have it. Yeap, this is so. As for being as good a car, I think not. It is close, but no cigar. Now, if bought at the right price, would it be a darn good buy for most people? Well, value has its place in the car world, and Sonata is certainly there -- buyer decision of say almost as good for thousands less up front, with thousand lost when later sold.Seems to be a wash in a way.

I drove the 2006 Sonata GLS I4 and Accord EX I4 back to back over the exact same course. I wrote a detailed review at the time, in another discussion. My conclusion was that the Sonata out-pointed the Accord, based on my criteria for mid-sized cars. My main issues with the Accord were a feel-every-bump ride (I know, some people like that; I don't); much less interior room; a cave-like interior with cheap-looking cloth (no longer an issue); lack of ESC (no longer an issue); and a much higher price. Also the Accord was the car with the rattles, interestingly enough (both were brand new, off dealer lots). And there's that Hyundai warranty of course. I also prefer the looks of the Sonata to the 2006-7 Accord (and the new Accord, for that matter), although I do like the dash on the Accord better, and it does have superior handling and slightly better fuel economy. But who knows, I might find the 2008 Accord tops the Sonata.The moral is, each buyer has to drive the cars against their criteria and see what comes out on top for them, and if it's the more expensive car, then how much is the difference worth to them?

I would say the top line Camry and the Tundra trucks may very well be overpriced. Not sure a $4K off sticker is enough to make them a buy or not. I certainly would not pay $26K for a Camry. But then again, I would not pay $34K to $45K for a CTS. I would say a Camry is worth up to $24K and a CTS perhaps $30K. A Sonata is perhaps worth up to $20K if loaded up. And a Fusion, perhaps is worth somewhere around $20K to 21K. The coming months should tell, if car sales really - really slide. And no, a Camry top of the line, is a bit out of control price wise. This is not a luxury car. What is a BMW3 now, say starting at $34k? Considering the Euro vs Dollar, those seem inexpensive. A fine RWD car, with world class handling is worth a lot more than a Camry XLE.L "

For a ride which absorbs the bumps, and is more smooth / easy going, perhaps one may consider the Camry. It tested a Sonata, and thought it had hit the stops a couple times, when impacting some holes and bumps in the road. Could be wrong, it made some sort of sound which was just like hitting the end of the shock travel. Yes, a Sonata seems very roomy. And you could also get an Azera for the Camry price. One thing though which is worrisome for those owners is lack of retail sales. Seems like Sonata and Azeras are not selling like they should. Many fleet sales of Sonatas to make up the difference. Could be just me, but it seems like a lot of buzz and some good sales going on for the Sonata, then it kinda hit the wall. It is a very crowded market. Have you noticed less Hyundai ads and more Kia these days, or is that just around my area? Oh yeah, I am kinda liking the looks of the Elantra these days. Nice looking smaller car.L "

the dealer didn't have v6 yet, so i test drove graphite on grey LX. and what a let down. it just felt like a bigger civic to me. i no longer want anything to do with 4 cylinders. accord felt like a civic's brother and i certainly didn't felt any of 177hp. i'm not even sure if i liked it more than the previous gen lx. interior looked great in person, but the over all interior volume looked about the same. i thought it became bigger, but i didn't see or feel any difference inside. the cloth was too smooth IMO. it's almost slippery. well, i'm going to test drive v6 whenever it comes out. but overall i'm thoroughly disappointed by honda. i would take the last gen's v6 over any 08's cylinder combination in a heartbeat. and the price is about the same anyway. probably cheaper because i can get a loaded exl v6 without the leather under 23k OTD. anyway, i test drove azera again shortly after my trip to honda dealer. loved everything about it except the green interior light. what a turn off.. gosh, there is no car out there for me.. oh by the way, i'm test driving because i'm trading my 06 civic. we need something bigger.

My 2003 had the 205/60-16 tires and I was able to replace them with a set of 2007 Accord rims and tires that I bought off of ebay for the price of new tires. The tires had little if any wear and the rims were spotless. The speedometer difference is only 0.9% difference which works out to about 1/2 mph at 60. This is well within the margin of error of factory speedometers. This gives me more options when I need new tires and better looking rims IMHO.Did you get 17"" wheels? I am pretty sure this is my only option at this point, and throwing some snow tire on the old rim or something. "

I just don't like the Camry that much. IMO quality has declined from past generations (esp. the interior), I don't like the looks, the ride is too soft (haven't tried the SE), and key features I want particularly VSC are options. I just don't see spending a lot more for it than for something like the Optima (which btw has bested the Camry I4 in several pro comparos).I am not worried about sales volumes. If I were, I'd buy an F Series or Silverado.  Sonatas and Optimas will not outsell Camcords anytime in the forseeable future, and that's not an issue as far as I am concerned. Little known fact that Hyundai has just about maxed out their production in Alabama, which makes Sonatas and Santa Fes. They did that while cutting back on Sonata rental sales compared to prior years. I've seen just as many Camrys in the Hertz lots lately as I have Sonatas. No one talks about that though. I don't see many ads for ANY cars lately, as I just don't watch much commercial TV anymore. No time, not much worth seeing. I'd rather watch a good movie. "

You didn't by any chance have the stick shift Starfire? It was so funny. You have to almost use two feet to depress the clutch, it was just so stiff. After a number of years, the plate which held the cable pulled straight on through the firewall. They welded on a plate and replace the cable line. One day, a friend jumps in the car, and pulls the door handle to close the door. It just came off. I looked at it and it was but a screw into who knows what, say cardboard. The car was the lime green metallic, and did look very cool when new. Thinking I was so smart to save money, and have an easier car to work on, I bought it without air conditioning. Well, let's just say, not the best of ideas on my part. Those Las Vegas trips got pretty hot. Olds. suspensions just ate the front tires like crazy. Oh well, I had fun, and it would not go fast enough to need much brake power. It had those matching color wheels -- woo-hoo! In 1977 model year, they counterbalanced the engine. Of course my car was the '76. Guess I should have gone all out and got a Datsun Z car, or something else. The Porsche 914 was cool, but only quick enough I guess, with that optional six engine. And there would go the price. Then came the Porsche 924 with the Audi truck engine. Ya know, come to think of it, things sure got weird. Jimmy Carter was president, there for awhile, and then there was disco. Heck, the only thing still normal was a Corvette  Well until the power meltdown. Oh yeah, the 80 MPH speedometers in Vettes and all cars, for that matter. Good God, I am having a flashback to 55 MPH speed limits. I best look ahead -- never back to that time. :surprise: Fast forward to today. Well the Corvette is looking good, but I don't have that sort of spare change at the moment. The '07 CTS was pretty neat, but then again, a bit pricey, and I am not sold on it being worth the price, though it may well be. Those GM cars of Epsilon aren't so bad, as long as you avoid the ones with electric assist steering. Heck, most of the GM stuff is not too bad category. The new and exciting below $25K price stuff is yet to come, as in the RWD cars. Sure the New Malibu and other Epsilons are adequate, to very good, but I am talking something new and enticing, like perhaps the Aussie cars, or the Impala to come. There is the new stuff =2009?L "

Although you so firmly believe Hyundai is an afterthought in this (or probably any other automotive size segment)please keep in mind that both Honda and Toyota have had decades (since at least 1976 for the Accord and 1985 for the Camry)to ""sell"" the buying public on the ""goodness"" of these cars. Hyundai is a new-comer"". Were the early versions of these great cars? In a word..NO. The Honda's rusted out early on (still do in certain rust belt regions)and Toyota has had their problems also. Refer to the recent ""sludge"" problems. Refer also to transmission problems on the Odyssey. Do these problems deter zelots from buying Honda and Toyota again? Nope...the next one will be better (for sure) but for joe average who decided to try one of those brands because of all the hyperbole and got problems instead of goodness, well they are among those who decided to give Hyundai a try.

heres the thing, you dont base a car's ""overpriced"" factor on its brand, you base it on the competition. There is no way the Fusion, Sonata or CTS could be considered overpriced when you compare them to key competitors. The Fusion is a value compared to the Japanese cars in this class, even with its weak V6 engine. I would sacrifice 40hp to save $3k because 221hp is enought o get the job done. Anytime a loaded Fusion with nav can be had for $28k or so the car is not overpriced. Same applies to sonata. How in the world could you pay $25k for an Accord SE and then say a Fusion is worth no more than $20k? A loaded Fusion has leather, heated seats, CD changer, nav, MP3 jack, lumbar support, split folding rear seat, 17"" wheels, etc. The idea that a CTS is worth no more than $30k with all the features it has is laughable.

The top sellers are benchmarks. It's pretty straight-forward. The mid-size sedan market is about large volume, that is the goal for the automakers. None of them have a goal of having the lowest selling model. Hence the best sellers are the bench mark. It mystifies why that is hard to grasp. If I am an engineer/ designer for Hyundai, I look at what Toyota (reliability & 'comfy' handling) and Honda (reliability & 'sporty' handling) are offering and I try to match their offering with whatever hook my brand represents. In Hyundai's case that seems to be value, which is a good thing.Do you think the vehicles that most buyers choose NOT to buy are the more important ones? "

It sold a lot because the camry is the default car choice for those who know little about cars or refuse to buy anything that isnt Japanese. If sales are your only criteria, than the F150 is indeed a benchmark. If you look at features, engines, trannies, interiors, etc. the F150 is not a benchmark. In terms of mainstream V8 engines the F150 is at the back of the pack. A huge ad budget, enormous production capacity and big discounts allow it to outsell the competition though. "

The F150 is the 3rd oldest pickup on the market and it has been surpassed by at least two, maybe three competitors. Ford makes a lot of em and sells em cheap, but that doesnt make it the benchmark. The F150 is barely even mentioned when talking about benchmark pickups in 2007. The 3 series sells in huge numbers based on peformance, reputation and a huge model lineup. No other competitor has 4 body styles and such a wide array of engines. The 3 series is one of the FEW examples of a benchmark vehicle that outsells the competition. The RX is another example of a vehicle that has been surpassed but continues to outsell all comers. "

I never asked if the Accord was hte bencmark when it was brand new in 2003, I was asking where it had been rated #1 recently outside of C&D which ALWAYS rates it #1.So it's unfair to point to comparisons when the Accord was new but not unfair to then compare that same car to newer competition?

Value. If I am ever a multi-millionaire, I still would not over pay for items. I had to work too hard over the early years, and place a higher value on a dollar than others, I guess. There is not enough of a value difference between a mid-range Camry and the top one's, which have mainly fluff, I would not need, nor want. The car, the nitty-gritty specs are just the same. Go ahead and let others pay a thousand say for some gold letters which are suppose to upgrade to the next class. I say ridiculous. As for a Corvette, it looks great and goes fast. The base model is just fine. No way is a $70K car. Give me a base, or near base model of a next class up car = value, instead of maxing out on a $44K car. That is unless I am going to the track. If I was Joe racer, then yeah, gotta loosen the purse strings. A CTS for $45K =  you gotta be kidding. Look, I kinda like the odd Art & Science look of the '07 models, and from test drives of those earlier models, I would say it was somewhat entertaining to drive, but really now, is it say a Bimmer? Or I would call up that largest dealer of Vettes and say send one out for $45K. Nope, a CTS looks to me like a good $30K car, and I have driven some used ones for under $20K which seem just fine. Good car, but not world class. It is just interesting.Did you know a long time back now, say a decade or two, they asked millionaires, perhaps it was self-made millionaires, what car they drive. The number one car was a Crown Victoria; a used Crown Victoria. There was the perceived value. When those which were out to impress, with those new high paying Internet and computer jobs bought BMW and Mercedes, they bought used Crown Vics. Now, I must say that is a bit far to go to save a buck, but you get the idea. These people have the money for a reason -- they can spot true value.And yes, I am but a poor boy. If ever so rich as afford a new Cadillac or Vette, I would have to justify it still as a value. It would not be one with junk on it just to impress. As for a Camry, those interiors look cheap to me, and the funny nose is a bit much. I ended up with an Accord SE V6 which is their best value, and passed on even test driving the Camry. The Aura seemed like the other good car. The Fusion and Sonata, IMHO, seem like the runners up awards cars. Oh yeah, the Altima I did drive, but was not impressed. Seems overpriced too.Loren "

hi Kirstie!Cars with low resale are normally low selling in the retail market, and thus the less desirable ones to begin with. It can be a precursor of things to come. Now some cars, in the high dollar, are not good resale due to those buying the cars. The high-rollers and flithy rich do not want to be seen in a used top line Mercedes say, or a Maserati, so they buy them new and dare we say, because they can do so. No one can afford to pay for those luxury cars until they fall down quite a ways in resale value, then the wannabes take charge of buying them. For the everyday Joe cars, those like the Malibu and Impala are selling in huge fleet sales amounts, and thus killing off resale hopes, which were never a strong point of the more recent history of GM's and Fords. A Taurus is a dime a dozen, is it not? So resale means a heck of allot as to how people view a cars percieved, if not true value.Loren "

Or you could consider the Toyota and Honda products as both different in nature, and equal benchmarks to the rest. The Camry and Corolla as good ol' reliable, sort of like your dog, and Honda as the quick and spunky cat. The Accord and Civic are cats.While it is important to keep an eye on what the number one, two and three are doing, being ahead of the game means coming up with the next best thing. For the domestics, I think that thing is first style, then engineering in decent fuel economy, and perfect ergonomics. Replicating the features, and how they screw together is all fine and dandy, but then you still have an "" all the rest "" sort of car. Sonata is a good car. At one time it had a more unique look to it. I think it is an example of a car which once again will do better when they venture out into the new looks, at which point they have good car, with some more captivating style. Not saying the current style is not good. It is just not grabbing the customers off the streets. I am afraid too many cars are just good enough in style. That said, what a great opportunity for the domestics. Chrysler cashed in, but had no follow through. And I am thinking the 300 had the style, and uniqueness of RWD, and AWD cars in a lower price range, but the style had this love it or hate it, or even worse I love it, but it ain't so practical effect. Those too tall doors, with the chop top was confining to some, and hard to see out of for others. Perhaps if they had three good styles between three sizes, more customers would have a choice in the Chrysler line. The Charger is just another 300, at a better price, with even cheaper looking interior, and the Sebring is a disaster. The rest are lower volume specialty cars. Not sure what a Caliber is suppose to be. Does Chrysler know? They have the Charger for value. Oh well.L "

A loaded Fusion has leather, heated seats, CD changer, nav, MP3 jack, lumbar support, split folding rear seat, 17"" wheels, etc. That's great that the Fusion has all those features, but just because it can match other cars in features, doesn't mean it matches in quality or value. the leather could be cheap low grade thin leather, the heated seats might be unreliable, the CD changer might have a low signal to noise ratio, the 17"" wheels might be heavier with a lesser finish than other 17"" rims. I would sacrifice 40hp to save $3k because 221hp is enought o get the job done.That's great that a heavy oversized 220 HP engine is good enough for you, but why not get 40 HP more and get better mileage to boot?Or why not just get 170 HP with a light 4 cylinder and get much better mileage. 170 HP will get the job done just as well, and save you that $3K.

Another very significant mid-sized car is the Passat. It is generally rated near the top of the mid-sized class. But its sales volume is also quite small.

Did you see what happened to GM and Ford's resale when they started doing zero interest and putting all kinds of rebates out there? They lost value even as the MSRP stayed the same.Well of course it did. Because if I bought car X for $25,000 and 3 years later they have the same MSRP but now have a $3K rebate then my 3 year old car is worth at least $3K less, maybe more. However, the depreciation on the new car that was purchased at $22,000 with the rebate will be basically the same after 3 years, provided the rebates don't increase. Conversely a decrease in rebates would provide better resale values for the older vehicle.Large rebates and rental fleet dumping are only necessary if you build more vehicles than the public wants to buy. This used to be the strategy at the domestic automakers because it was cheaper to do that than to reduce production or close plants because the autoworkers got paid either way.Ford's inventory levels are so low this year that they cancelled the normal labor day sale, instead they're only doing the normal model year closeout sale. They're learning and it will show in the new 09 Fusion out next year. "

you will not see any domestic or Korean car outselling the camry anytime soon, probably never. Its not going to happen.

The domestic brands dominate the pickuup segment, but you cannot say the same for camcord. You can say that they outsell the nameplates they compete against.Frankly GM has gotten its midsize cars together and they are only going to get better. Ford and Chrysler are just doing OK and have some work to do. Hopefully the 2009 fusion will address that car's weaknesses.

its pretty obvious that your are an accord cheerleader and will not be realistic about the car's merits.This discussion began when you stated that the Accord was not a benchmark in the class. Since we are discussing the various perspectives that (IMO) make it a benchmark, it would not make a lot of sense for me not to think it's a bench mark right?I chose the phrase 'ride quality' carefully because I do not believe that plush is a sign of great ride quality. Ride quality is a balance of confident road holding and handling without beating the occupants up. That may have some subjective elements to it. If you prefer a soft ride then that would explain a lot of your down-playing of the Accord's influence in this class. If you value saving money up front, again, that explains your perspective on the car. That's neither right or wrong, but you and I do not have the same goals with our vehicles obviously.just traded in a car and I can tell you KBB wont get you far at a dealership so good luck if you think that is your saving grace.So how was your trade in valued? I assume you knew what the value would have been in KBB, was it higher or lower? Were you expecting sale price and got wholesale? If it was not on KBB, why not? You are in a big market- a dealer has no reason to come off of the industry standard.FWIW, I absolutely expect KBB wholesale to be the minimum price offered when trading unless the car has exceptionally low miles/ wear or exceptionally high mile/ wear. If it is lower, the dealership doesn't want my trade and I move on, and if I can get higher, great. "

This is not the 80s or 90s, Toyota and Honda do not have fit/finish that blows away the competiton anymore. Engineers and designers are pretty smart people- if given the authority and money to develop high quality parts that can be assembled with tight tolerances they will do so.

So manufacturing capacity and number of stores have nothing to do with units sold? The fact that, for example, one company has capacity to turn out a maximum of, say, 150,000 units a year compared to another that can turn out 500,000 units a year with more than twice as many stores to sell them makes no difference? The higher-volume car must obviously be superior? Sorry, that doesn't make sense to me. Doesn't make sense to the folks at CR also, who rated the Passat turbo the top I4 family sedan and the Passat V6 the top V6 family sedan (tied with Accord). And they recommend the V6 based on its reliability and safety. The turbo I4 must be less reliable than the V6, since CR did not recommend the turbo. "

""I chose the phrase 'ride quality' carefully because I do not believe that plush is a sign of great ride quality. Ride quality is a balance of confident road holding and handling without beating the occupants up. That may have some subjective elements to it. If you prefer a soft ride then that would explain a lot of your down-playing of the Accord's influence in this class. If you value saving money up front, again, that explains your perspective on the car. That's neither right or wrong, but you and I do not have the same goals with our vehicles obviously. ""ride quality and sportiness are not the same. I am not one for Lexus like isolation in a car. The Accord is neither the sportiest car in this class nor is it the smoothest riding. Its in the middle somewhere. It doesnt ride softer than the Lacrosse or camry and its not as sporty as the Fusion, Altima or Aura. Its right in the middle.we need to separate the accord from being your fave car from it being the benchmark. Its obviously the former and obviosuly not the latter based on any objective evaluation. I think people who refuse to drive the competition are the first ones to put the accord on a pedastal. Until you drive the best of the rest you dont know whats out there and you go on believing Honda has a magic formula. You cannot force a dealer to give you KBB value- trust me. My brother and I both traded in cars recently and it does not work. Dealers have a lot of explanations, some of which are legit, as to why they are not going to hand over what KBB says. My car was not in demand but my brother's car was and he still got a grand less than KBB value. Its not as easy as you make it seem. Furthermore different sites give different numbers so you have no solid reliably data. I saw values froom $6100-$8000 for my car online. "

If I told VW today that I was willing to buy 400,000 base model Passats at 30K each, and forked over an advance of 25% of the money, I bet they would sign the contract and find/obtain/acquire the capacity to build them within the next year.

""So if it's not the Camry and it's not the Accord, what is the best selling mid-size sedan? ""let me try to be more explicit here. You have to look at TOTAL sales of all brands. Domination is what the big 3 have in the pickup market- they sell about 90% of the pickups in this country. Accord and camry are best sellers but those cars do not dominate the midsize car market. They cant when GM sells more midsize cars than either Toyota or Honda. The G6, Malibu and Impala alone reprsented around 600k sales in 2006 which is more than Accord by a large margin and above Camry by a significant margin. Those two nameplates are very successful and top the sales charts, but their combined sales do not equal domination of the market. You can make the argument that civic and corolla dominate the compact market because those two vehicles single handedly make up a huge chunk of that overall market. "

Another very significant mid-sized car is the Passat. It is generally rated near the top of the mid-sized class. But its sales volume is also quite small. Does that make it an unimportant car, an inferior car? Yes, the answer is yes, the Passat is an inferior car when it comes to durability, reliability, and dependability. If it was as ""good"" as the Camry and Accord in those areas, then it would sell just as much (or right in between) the Camry and Accord (provided they don't raise the pricing)Given the number of 10-15 year old VWs I see cruising around in the midwest, and the number of 20+ year old VWs on the west coast, I would say their durability is fine.I would be more concerned with the durability of a contemporary BMW with so few maintenance requirements.

Also, I have never had to accept less than KBB wholesale for any car I have traded (inc Saab, Isuzu, Jeep, Acura, Nissan and Infiniti- enough variety that I do not accept the idea that the dealer sets the standard).I do think that the Accord and the Camry define the segment currently.

Yes, I will bet that VW would love to sell you 400,000 base Passats at a big premium over MSRP. But whether they would be able to ramp up plant capacity within a year is questionable. Look at Toyota a few years ago. They had lots of hungry buyers waiting over a year for a Prius, and they were willing to spend MSRP or over to get them. Yet it took them a couple of years to ramp up more capacity. Why not deal with more realistic scenarios? Do you know anyone who will offer to buy 400,000 mid-sized family cars at a big premium over MSRP and pay a $3 billion advance (interest free, of course)? I don't. "

What assistance would the average ""not dumb"" person need for roadside assisstance other than for mechanical failures (which we've established is unnecessary for Honda's)???Nobody could handle living with a Chrysler POS car for more than a few years, so that's why they can offer a lifetime warranty which is really only a 3/36K warranty unless you meet about 45 specific conditions, requirements, catches, hooks, lines, and sinkers. So much fine print tells me they don't believe for a second their cars will go the distance. Also, you should ask Chrysler where you should get your warranty service when they go bankrupt? Is there a secured account somewhere that may only be used to pay off warranty claims? Has this secured account been funded properly (10K per vehicle would be proper if you ask me for a Chrylser).Have you received answers to these questions?The average car buyer might only keep their car less than 6 years or 100K miles, but they should still care how it performs after they own it!!!! Why? because the 2nd owner will care! And that second owner cares because they are not going to pay for a junker.

My example was an example, of how supply will meet demand, given enough sustained demand, or enough high dollar offers. If VW didn't have the plant capacity, then they could buy or build new plants fast tracked, then start pumping out more Passats, all probably within 10 months. Or they could pay some other auto plant to retool to build Passats instead of Jettas, or even Passats instead of Audi's, or even pay Honda to start making Passats in Ohio..... Given enough money, all are possiblities. "

Accord and Camry are dominant nameplates in the segment. Toyota and Honda are not the dominant players in the midsize segment. TOyota is a strong second but GM is the leader in midsize car sales. Its great that the camry is the best selling car but at the end of the day all of GM's various models represent a sale for ONE company. all of the camrys sales represent a unit sold for ONE company. GM offers different styles and names to get sales why Toyota pushes one car for all buyers and thus Toyota can sell 400k of the same car. I would be lying if I told you I thought that GM models its car after the camry. They may aim for camry reliability but thats about it. When it comes to syling and handling I would say GM is most definitely not trying to out Camry the camry. I dont think Chevy is too worried about the Impala since its going to rack up over 300k sales this year and it outsold the accord a few times this year. What would make you think other brands (including Nissan) wouldnt want the Impala's sales? Isnt it whipping the sonata, 6, Passat and Fusion in sales right now? There are only going to be three midsize cars that crack 300k sales this year and one is Impala so I'm not sure how you figure GM doesnt have a recipe for success with that car. The opinions of the press and import leaning domestic bashers is one thing, what the marketplace says is another. seeing as though Nissan and Hyundai are selling cars to rental agencies left and right I do get tired of the whole ""impala is only doing well because of fleets"" argument. If sales are all you care about than the F150 is the best vehicle in the country, period. And the Silverado is the 2nd best. Their sales make the Camrys sales look modest. "

Anything but acknowlegde that Chrysler is standing behind their product. The powertrain is covered as long as you get the car checked every 5 years- its so simple anyone can do it. we can either base our evaluation of the warranty on what chrysler says in the fine print- or we can base it on your erroneous statement in the previous post that has no backing. There go those pesky facts again, funny how they ruin those rants of yours. If you think chrysler is going bankrupt I suggest you do some more research. I'm sure Jim Press took that job because he feels Chrysler is on the verge of collapse. Until recently Chrysler was responsible for the majority of the profits generated by DC because the Germans had made so many dumb decisions regarding the Smart car and other things. Chrysler was doing better than Mercedes in terms of profitability. I dont think Cerberus is in the business of taking over companies that are headed for bankruptcy. roadside assistance is like AAA coverage. Check it out- everyone but Toyota and Honda have it.

Actually going by your perspective the GM twins are the best selling trucks because it's the leader with all the vehicles it brings to the sector. It's pretty clear we disagree on the definition of a bench mark vehicle. I think the 'benchmark' is a vehicle that sets the standard in a segment, it's a combination of all the things which customers tend to buy for and has powerful influence on all competitors. I truly do not understand what you consider a benchmark to be.You and I will have to disagree on what makes a leader in a particular segment.

AAA for towing. Great insurance company too!As for warranty work, the local dealership can supply you with a car. It is not required though by warranty. There are all sorts of dealerships in the World, and over time you find the good, the bad and the plain ugly ones. I don't think they need to go to a lifetime warranty for powertrain. I would want to see any such warranties finest print. Overall, I would say the warranty provided by Honda could be improved however. Like any car I buy, if it sucks over the years, it is basically gone anyway. So if it becomes a dog for two to three years, by the time the warranty is nearing an end, I would be out of it anyway. All cars can have problems, and personally I think they should add to and adjust some things in the Honda warranty. Lifetime warranty??? Nahhh, sound like one of those too good to be true.

""No one likes repairs on their car but I fail to see how its a huge hassle unless you live 50 miles from a dealership. I would say 90% of what goes wrong with todays cars can be fixed at an oil change""It wasn't just the need for repairs on my brand new 2004 $29k MSRP Ford, it was the general ownership experience that turned out to be a huge hassle.Examples of me enjoying my new Ford...- Wanting to back into a parking spot, I stop and shift into reverse, wait a second, then move from the brake to the gas. The engine revs freely, with no vehicular movement, and then BANG! It finally jolts into gear and off shoots backwards. The dealer puts a transmission additive in, which has little effect.- I'm just crusing down the road with my foot on the gas. The engine is lazily turning 2,000 RPMs. Suddenly, the car in front starts slowing down, so I let off the gas, and BANG! the transmission jolts into neutral, feeling like I have just run something over. The dealer can't ever seem to replicate the problem.- I wake up to go to work, get in the car and try to crank it. The starter chugs along, but the engine just won't catch. I try this several more times. I swear at it. I consider lighting it on fire. Instead, I wait a few minutes and try it again. It finally coughs back to life with a very rough idle. I keep my foot on the gas and wait a minute just in case. Again, the dealer can't find anything wrong. ""There are no trouble codes in the computer."" At least, each time this happens, I've got a few months before it happens again.These are just three examples... Sure, it was rated average in CR, and probably only has a couple more problems than a top-rated car; but living with it every day was a pain- and forget being fixed at oil changes, the dealer couldn't ever fix it, period! Now I drive a new Honda, and (knock on wood) it has no such quality issues. I bought the Honda partly because it has less of a chance of ever being such a nusiance to own. "

Toyota & GM gives you guys what they want you to have.Ford is dead, but they don't know it yet.The oil companies just keep getting richer and nobody can unseat a member of congress and life goes on. "

What weaknesses?  you have goota be kidding - ALL these cars as well as ALL others have weaknesses. Even the generally acknowledged leaders can be rightfully cited for higher initial costs, hard to cope with dealers, somewhat subjective styling evaluations etc. The Fusion(and to a lesser extent the 6)? What is under the hoods,4 and 6 cylinder, obviously the biggest points. If they are good enough for you is not the point, they do not measure up to what can be found in several of these cars from either a HP or FE standpoint. In my own case, for example, Ford could reduce the price of a V6 Fusion to $10k and I would still pay the extra $15k or so for what is in a Camcordima (or even a Sonata) - such is the value I put on drivetrain sophistication (or lack of it).What you personally 'value' may be different, which of course is fine - but ALL these cars have quantifiable weaknesses "

Well the cheapest service didn't have a price beside it; but I could really stand to have new blades and my car vacuumed.Wal-Mart uses a Fram filter and Castrol. "
